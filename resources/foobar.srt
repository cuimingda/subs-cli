1
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,900
Oh, okay.

2
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,900
好的。

3
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,490
Where are we now?

4
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,490
我们现在在哪里？

5
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,490
Got the VRI for our\Ndeaf patient in Central 12.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,490
我们在中央 12 号房间为聋人患者启动了视频远程口译服务。

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,530
Still waiting on Pedes\Nfor Baby Jane Doe.

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,530
还在等儿科医生来看 Baby Jane Doe。

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,500
Central 6 is sitting pretty\Nwith his insulin drip.

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,500
中央 6 号房间的患者胰岛素输液进行得很顺利。

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,120
And the Westbridge\Ndiversions are

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,120
而韦斯特布里奇的改道车辆

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,450
kindly waiting\Ntheir turn to sit

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,450
正在我们美丽的大厅里

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,040
for hours in our lovely halls.

16
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,040
耐心地等待他们的轮次坐上几个小时。

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,000
You are some kind of savant.

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,000
你是某种天才。

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,080
Worthy of a raise?

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,080
值得加薪吗？

21
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,960
Just more of my love.

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,960
只是我更多的爱。

23
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,340
I got enough of that.

24
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,340
我已经受够了。

25
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,590
I have a sexual\Nassault victim in triage.

26
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,590
我在分诊室有一名性攻击受害者。

27
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,960
I called PAAR,\Nso an advocate is on the way.

28
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,960
我打电话给了 PAAR，所以一名倡导者正在赶来。

29
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,090
Okay. We'll take care of it.

30
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,090
好的。我们会处理好的。

31
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,230
Uh, Dr. McKay, what's going on\Nwith your patient in Central 9?

32
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,230
呃，麦凯医生，中央 9 号病房你的患者怎么样了？

33
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,560
Isn't she good to go?

34
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,560
她不是可以出院了吗？

35
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,270
Oh, she was, but she decided

36
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,270
哦，她本来是可以的，但她改主意了

37
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,770
she wanted to stay\Nin the hospital now

38
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,770
她现在想留在医院

39
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,100
because she's in too much pain.

40
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,100
因为她疼痛太厉害了。

41
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,980
In our loud\Nand overcrowded ED

42
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,980
在我们嘈杂拥挤的急诊科

43
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,310
with more Westbridge cases\Narriving every moment?

44
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,310
每时每刻都有更多韦斯特布里奇的病例到来？

45
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,320
She would be\Nmore comfortable at home.

46
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,320
她在家会更舒适。

47
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,740
The debrief was lovely.

48
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,740
事后总结很愉快。

49
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,280
Thank you.

50
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,280
谢谢你。

51
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,330
Would you mind helping Dana\Nwith a sexual assault victim

52
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,330
你能帮 Dana 处理一个性侵犯受害者吗

53
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,250
- who just came in?\N- Of course. Sure.

54
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,250
- 刚刚来的？ - 当然，没问题。

55
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,080
Why don't you and I go\Nsee if we can't convince

56
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,080
你和我一起去看看能不能说服

57
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,830
- your patient to leave?\N- All right.

58
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,830
- 你的病人离开？ - 好的。

59
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,500
I need to take care of a sexual\Nassault victim in triage.

60
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,500
我需要在分诊处照顾一个性侵犯受害者。

61
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,250
One of you needs\Nto hold down the fort.

62
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,250
你们中有人需要坚守阵地。

63
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,930
We can call for a SANE.\NOn a holiday? Could be hours.

64
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,930
我们可以叫一个性侵犯审查员。在假日？可能要等几个小时。

65
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,680
We're not gonna make\Nthis patient wait.

66
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,680
我们不能让这个患者等待。

67
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,890
And since I'm the only\NSANE on staff--

68
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,890
既然我是员工中唯一的性侵犯审查员——

69
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,310
Princess will cover.

70
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,310
公主会顶替。

71
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,770
Hey! Hey!

72
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,770
嘿！嘿！

73
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,310
You two better not be\Nteaching her any bad habits.

74
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,310
你们两个最好别教她坏习惯。

75
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,890
- Come on. You ready, Doc?\N- Sure.

76
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,890
- 来吧。你准备好了吗，医生？- 当然。

77
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,860
A SANE is a Sexual Assault\NNurse Examiner.

78
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,860
SANE 是性侵犯护士检查员。

79
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,980
We do forensic exams,\Ncollect evidence,

80
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,980
我们进行法医检查，收集证据，

81
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,690
and hand it over to the police\Nif a report is made.

82
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,690
如果有报告提交，就将其交给警方。

83
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,690
We also provide\Nresources, support,

84
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,690
我们还提供资源、支持，

85
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,990
- sometimes even testimony.\N- You go to court?

86
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,990
- 有时甚至提供证词。- 你要上法庭吗？

87
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,950
SANEs are very valuable in\Na hospital, especially an ED.

88
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,950
性侵犯护士检查员在医院中非常有价值，尤其是在急诊科。

89
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,910
More nurses should\Ntrain for it.

90
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,910
更多护士应该接受这方面的培训。

91
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,160
That's a not so subtle hint.

92
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,160
这是个不太含蓄的暗示。

93
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,340
Looks like this is\Nthe new hot spot, huh?

94
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,340
看起来这里是新的热门地点，是吧？

95
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,840
And only getting hotter.

96
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,840
而且越来越热了。

97
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,760
Any word on what's\Ngoing on with Westbridge?

98
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,760
有什么关于韦斯特布里奇的消息吗？

99
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,090
I got 20 on lantern flies.

100
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,090
我赌 20 块钱是灯蛾。

101
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,140
Nope, nothing.

102
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,140
不，什么都没有。

103
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,560
These patient passports have\Nan interesting alternative use.

104
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,560
这些患者护照有一个有趣的替代用途。

105
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,060
Where's the sexual\Nassault victim?

106
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,060
性侵犯受害者在哪里？

107
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,640
She's in Triage, Chair 2.

108
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,640
她在分诊区，椅子 2 号。

109
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,650
Thanks, Lupe.

110
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,650
谢谢你，卢佩。

111
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,690
Here's her intake.

112
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,690
这是她的初诊记录。

113
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,690
Got it.

114
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,690
明白了。

115
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,030
Hi, Ms. Miller.

116
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,030
你好，米勒女士。

117
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,320
I'm Dana.

118
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,320
我是达娜。

119
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,870
How are you doing?

120
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,870
你好吗？

121
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,500
- I've been better.\N- Yeah.

122
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,500
- 我见过更好的情况。- 是的。

123
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,920
You're in a safe place now.

124
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,920
你现在在一个安全的地方。

125
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,670
I'm the charge nurse in the ED

126
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,670
我是急诊科的护士长

127
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,920
and a sexual assault\Nnurse examiner.

128
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,920
也是性侵犯护理检查员。

129
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,630
This is Emma,\Nwho will be assisting.

130
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,630
这是艾玛，她会协助我们。

131
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,130
And I'm Dr. Al-Hashimi.

132
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,130
我是哈希米医生。

133
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,500
I'll be checking you\Nfor any injuries

134
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,500
我会检查你是否有任何需要立即处理的伤害。

135
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,220
that need immediate attention.

136
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,220
你可以叫我伊拉娜。

137
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,090
You can just call me Ilana.

138
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,090
我没有任何伤害。

139
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,430
I don't have any injuries.

140
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,430
I don't have any injuries.

141
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,100
Okay, that's good.

142
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,100
好的，很好。

143
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,890
We're gonna get\Na room ready for you.

144
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,890
我们会为你准备一个房间。

145
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,970
Meanwhile, Dr. Al-Hashimi is\Ngonna ask you a few questions.

146
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,970
同时，哈希米医生会问你几个问题。

147
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,060
How long is this gonna take?

148
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,060
这要花多长时间？

149
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,640
I can't promise\Nan exact time,

150
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,640
我无法保证具体的时间。

151
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,650
but we'll try to be\Nas fast as you need.

152
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,650
但我们会尽快为你服务。

153
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,230
- Thank you.\N- Yeah.

154
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,230
- 谢谢。- 好的。

155
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,450
Okay, Ilana, do you take any\Nprescription medications?

156
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,450
好的，伊拉娜，你服用任何处方药吗？

157
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,450
Just Synthroid,\None tab a day.

158
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,450
只有合成代谢激素，每天一片。

159
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,410
Okay, and any allergies\Nto medications?

160
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,410
好的，你对药物有过敏吗？

161
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,450
- No. No.\N- Okay.

162
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,450
- 不。不。- 好的。

163
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,500
Dana will come get you\Nwhen the room is ready,

164
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,500
房间准备好后，Dana 会来接你。

165
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,920
and I'll be back\Nto finish your exam.

166
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,920
我会回来给你做完检查。

167
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,260
Come find me\Nwhen she's in a gown.

168
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,260
她换上病号服后来找我。

169
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,840
Will do.

170
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,840
没问题。

171
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,680
We're gonna use Triage Exam\NRooms 1 and 2 for this.

172
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,680
我们将使用分诊考试室 1 和 2 来进行。

173
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,680
It's the most private space\Nwe have away from the ED.

174
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,680
这是我们远离急诊科最私密的空间。

175
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,480
All right, this can be a lot.

176
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,480
好的，这可能会很复杂。

177
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,440
You up for it?

178
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,440
你准备好了吗？

179
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,600
Yeah.

180
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,600
好的。

181
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,320
Yes. I'm good.

182
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,320
好的。我没问题。

183
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,820
Let me know if\Nyou need to step out.

184
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,820
如果你需要出去，告诉我一声。

185
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,650
Yes.

186
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,650
好的。

187
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,420
Dr. Ellis.

188
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,420
埃利斯医生。

189
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,590
- Oh, no.\N- Oh, yes.

190
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,590
- 哦，不。- 哦，是的。

191
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,830
Need the room.

192
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,830
需要用这个房间。

193
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,840
Find another place\Nto lay your head.

194
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,840
找个别的地方睡觉去。

195
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,420
Not even\Na 20-minute power nap?

196
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,420
连 20 分钟的小睡都不行？

197
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,040
You know, my double is at 1:30.\NI'm--

198
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,040
你知道，我的双人房在 1 点 30 分。我——

199
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,050
Nope, we're getting\NWestbridge diversions.

200
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,050
不行，我们要处理韦斯特布里奇的改道问题。

201
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,260
And chairs is insane.

202
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,260
椅子多得疯了。

203
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,760
- Did you see out there?\N- No.

204
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,760
- 你看到外面了吗？- 没有。

205
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,470
I do not come in\Nthrough that mess.

206
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,470
我不会穿过那堆乱七八糟的东西进去。

207
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,220
Okay.

208
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,220
好的。

209
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,440
Yeah.

210
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,440
好的。

211
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,890
People sleep in here?

212
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,890
人们在这里睡觉？

213
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,100
Yeah, the night shift docs\Njust need rest,

214
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,100
是的，夜班医生就是需要休息，

215
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,030
especially if they have to\Ncome in during the day.

216
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,030
特别是如果他们白天还要来。

217
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
But today, we can't\Nwaste the space.

218
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
但今天，我们不能浪费床位。

219
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,530
I need you to get me a stool on\Nwheels and Esme for a turnover.

220
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,530
我需要你给我拿一个带轮子的凳子，还有埃斯梅来交接班。

221
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,910
So you're having a headache\Nand abdominal pain?

222
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,910
所以你是头痛和腹痛？

223
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,210
Yeah, that's right.

224
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,210
是的，没错。

225
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,040
Okay, and which would\Nyou say is worse?

226
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,040
好的，那你说哪个更糟？

227
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,130
My headache was terrible\Nlast week...

228
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,130
我上周的头痛很厉害...

229
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,170
But now--

230
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,170
但现在--

231
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,430
Hey, you're--\Nyou're breaking up.

232
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,430
嘿，你--你的信号断了。

233
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,050
Can you run that back again?

234
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,050
你能再重复一遍吗？

235
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,640
Sure.

236
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,640
当然可以。

237
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,730
My headache was terrible\Nlast week...

238
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,730
我上周的头痛很厉害...

239
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,310
But now my abdominal pain--

240
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,310
但现在我的腹痛--

241
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Oh, my God.

242
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
天哪。

243
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,440
Come on, you piece of--

244
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,440
来吧，你这个——

245
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,030
fuck.

246
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,030
混蛋。

247
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,530
Um--

248
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,530
嗯——

249
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,720
I'll--I'll be right back.

250
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,720
我——我马上回来。

251
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,600
Sorry.

252
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,600
抱歉。

253
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,110
Um, Dr. Al-Hashimi?

254
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,110
嗯，Al-Hashimi 医生？

255
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,860
Jackson's parents are here.

256
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,860
Jackson 的父母来了。

257
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,400
Okay. I'll take that.

258
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,400
好的。我接手了。

259
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,330
Um, Mr. and Mrs. Davis,\Nthis is one of my attendings,

260
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,330
嗯，Davis 先生和 Davis 太太，这是我的一位主治医生，

261
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,580
- Dr. Al-Hashimi.\N- Hi. Nice to meet you.

262
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,580
- Al-Hashimi 医生。- 你好。很高兴认识你。

263
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,700
- Demi.\N- Charles.

264
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,700
- 德米。- 查尔斯。

265
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,540
What the hell's going on?

266
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,540
到底发生了什么？

267
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,460
He's barely conscious.

268
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,460
他几乎没有意识。

269
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,170
Jackson's just a little tired\Ndue to the sedative

270
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,170
杰克逊只是因为镇静剂有点累

271
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,250
- he was given.\N- You sedated him?

272
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,250
- 你给他用了镇静剂？- 他被注射了镇静剂。

273
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,620
Oh, your son was brought in\Nextremely agitated.

274
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,620
哦，你儿子被送进来时非常躁动。

275
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,960
You'd be, too,\Nif you were tased.

276
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,960
如果你被电击枪电过，你也会这样。

277
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,220
And why the fuck\Ndid they do that?

278
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,220
他们为什么要这样做？

279
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,970
This is bullshit.\NWe're taking him home.

280
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,970
这太荒唐了。我们要把他带回家。

281
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,090
Why don't we step out\Nfor a second?

282
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,090
我们出去谈一下好吗？

283
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,860
Right now, Jackson is on\Nan involuntary psych hold.

284
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,860
杰克逊现在被强制进行精神卫生观察。

285
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,780
What?\NThat's not necessary.

286
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,780
什么？这没必要。

287
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,150
He just needs some rest.

288
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,150
他只是需要休息。

289
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,120
He's been studying\Nfor the bar exam.

290
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,120
他一直在为律师资格考试复习。

291
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,540
We can watch him at home.

292
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,540
我们可以在家照看他。

293
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,110
So far, all of his tests\Nlook good,

294
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,110
到目前为止，他的所有检查结果都很好，

295
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,200
but Jackson has\Nreported hearing voices.

296
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,200
但杰克逊报告说听到了声音。

297
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,780
This could be serious.

298
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,780
这可能很严重。

299
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,870
Dr. Jefferson will come back\Nand speak with you.

300
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,870
杰斐逊医生会回来和你谈话。

301
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,050
He can explain more of what\Nmay be going on with Jackson.

302
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,050
他可以更详细地解释杰克逊可能发生了什么。

303
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,550
And who is Dr. Jefferson?

304
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,550
杰斐逊医生是谁？

305
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,510
He's from Psychiatry,\Nand he's excellent.

306
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,510
他来自精神病学科，非常出色。

307
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,630
He can explain next steps and\Nanswer all of your questions.

308
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,630
他可以解释后续步骤并回答你们的所有问题。

309
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,210
Javadi, why don't you take\Nthe Davises to the family room?

310
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,210
贾瓦迪，你能带戴维斯一家去家庭房吗？

311
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,590
- Sure.\N- Excuse me.

312
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,590
- 好的。- 对不起。

313
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,060
It's just this way.

314
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,060
就是这样。

315
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,250
You have reached the\NPittsburgh Neuroscience Group.

316
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,250
您已拨通匹兹堡神经科学集团。

317
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,290

318
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,290

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,850
Hi, this is\NDr. Baran al-Hashimi.

328
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,850
你好，我是巴兰·哈希米医生。

329
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,770
I'm a patient\Nof Dr. Fairgraves.

330
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,770
我是费尔格雷夫斯医生的患者。

331
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,650
I need to speak to him\Nif he's on call.

332
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,650
如果他值班，我需要和他谈话。

333
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,980
If he's not, I'll take his\Nnext available appointment.

334
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,980
如果他没有，我会预约他下一个可用的时间。

335
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,310
And please call me\Nif he has a cancellation.

336
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,310
如果他有取消的预约，请打电话给我。

337
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,190
Thank you.

338
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,190
谢谢你。

339
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,740
Like I said, you're more than\Nwelcome to stay down here

340
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,740
就像我说的，欢迎你在这里等待

341
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,570
until an inpatient bed\Nopens up upstairs.

342
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,570
直到楼上有床位空出来。

343
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,960
But that can take a while,\Nsometimes days,

344
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,960
但那可能需要一段时间，有时要几天，

345
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,280
even longer.

346
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,280
会更长。

347
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,870
It's gonna be\Nreally noisy here,

348
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,870
这里会非常吵闹，

349
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,370
and you won't get any rest.

350
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,370
你无法得到任何休息。

351
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,170
At home, you'll be\Nsurrounded by your family

352
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,170
在家里，你会被家人包围

353
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,670
and be more comfortable.

354
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,670
会更加舒适。

355
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,960
It's your choice, Roxie.

356
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,960
这是你的选择，罗克西。

357
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,890
It's not that\NI don't wanna go home, but--

358
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,890
不是我不想回家，而是——

359
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,970
- Hi, Mom.\N- Mom.

360
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,970
- 嗨，妈妈。- 妈妈。

361
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,760
Lena texted me to come back.\NI figured I'd bring the boys.

362
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,760
莱娜给我发短信让我回来。我想我会把孩子们也带回去。

363
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,270
What's going on?\NIs everything okay?

364
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,270
发生什么事了？一切都好吗？

365
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,060
Robby, police officer,\Nincoming trauma.

366
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,060

368
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,190
来了。

369
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,520
I'll be right back.

370
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,520
我马上回来。

371
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,280
We'll give you\Na chance to talk.

372
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,280
我们会给你机会说话。

373
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,360
Okay, why don't you\Nhave a seat?

374
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,360
好的，你为什么不坐下呢？

375
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,540
Do you need anything\Nbefore we begin?

376
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,540
开始前你需要什么吗？

377
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,930
You're in control now, Ilana.

378
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,930
现在由你掌控，伊拉娜。

379
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,640
We're here to help\Nand support you.

380
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,640
我们在这里帮助和支持你。

381
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,100
Once I open this kit,\NI cannot leave the room.

382
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,100
一旦我打开这个工具包，我就不能离开这个房间。

383
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,180
But if you need a break\Nor some air, just let us know.

384
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,180
但如果你需要休息或透透气，就告诉我们。

385
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,440
Okay? Emma can go\Nwith you if you like.

386
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,440
好吧？如果你愿意，艾玛可以和你一起去。

387
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,980

391
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,360

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,360
- 我们可以开始吗？- 当然可以。

393
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,730
I'm gonna put my face shield on

394
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,730
我要戴上面罩

395
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,950
so I don't\Ncontaminate anything.

396
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,950
所以我不会污染任何东西。

397
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,910
Emma has already done the same.

398
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,910
艾玛已经做过同样的事情了。

399
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,990
Now, in order for the doctor\Nto do her exam,

400
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,990
现在，为了让医生进行她的检查，

401
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,370
I need you in a gown,

402
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,370
我需要你穿上手术服，

403
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,800
but I need to collect\Nyour clothing first.

404
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,800
但我需要先收集你的衣服。

405
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,870
Is that okay?

406
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,870
可以吗？

407
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,670
I'm gonna need you to undress\Non top of these pads.

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,670
我需要你在这些垫子上脱衣服。

409
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,600
Put each item of clothing\Non the pads, okay?

410
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,600
把每件衣服都放在垫子上，好吗？

411
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,270
Then we'll package each piece\Nin a separate bag.

412
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,270
然后我们会把每一件都单独装在一个袋子里。

413
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,390
We'll get you new clothes.

414

我们会给你买新衣服。

415
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,760

00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,760

417
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,520
Emma's gonna be\Nbehind this curtain,

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,520

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,560

421
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,570
And take off your shoes first.

422
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,570
先脱掉你的鞋。

423
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,110
When you're done,\NI want you to put on your gown

424
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,110
完成后，我要你穿上你的病号服

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,200

426

后面开口。

427
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,640
What if the mom\Ndoesn't wanna leave?

428
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,640
如果妈妈不想离开怎么办？

429
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,100
Well, then she's gonna\Nhave to put up with us.

430
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,100
好吧，那她就得忍受我们了。

431
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,770
I can't imagine--her boys.

432
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,770
我无法想象——她的孩子们。

433
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,490
Oh, don't go there.

434
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,490
哦，别往那方面想。

435
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,240
I'm gonna see if\NI can grease the wheels,

436
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,240
我会试试能否加快进度，

get her a room upstairs soon.

438
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,450
尽快给她安排楼上的房间。

439
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,370
Good luck.\NWhat was that?

440
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,370
祝你好运。那是什么？

你还想要我的长子吗？

我们被转移到这里。有创伤室空着吗？

465
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,720

00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,780
Are you serious?

488
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,780
你是认真的吗？

489
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,450
I go in with the team\Nin case there's an injury.

490
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,450
我和队伍一起进去，以防有人受伤。

491
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,910
That's badass.

492
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,910
太酷了。

493
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,530
Dr. Santos, let's make sure\Nthese lungs are up.

494
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,530
桑托斯医生，我们确保这些肺部功能正常。

495
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,330
- Could you see the cords?\N- Yeah, there was a great view,

496
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,330
- 你能看到声带吗？- 是的，视野很清楚，

497
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,120
but it was hard to pass\Nafter I cleared them.

498
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,120
但我清理后很难通过。

499
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,960
Yeah, sats down to 85.

500
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,960
是的，血氧饱和度降到 85。

501
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,000
Dr. Santos, what could\Ncause respiratory failure

502
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,000
桑托斯医生，什么可能导致插管患者呼吸衰竭

503
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,580
in an intubated patient?

504
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,580
在插管患者中？

505
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,920
There are a lot\Nof possibilities.

506
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,920
有很多可能性。

507
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,340
Think DOPE.

508
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,340
想想 DOPE。

509
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,710
Displacement, Obstruction,\NPneumothorax,

510
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,710
移位、阻塞、气胸、

511
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,050
Equipment failure.

512
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,050
装备故障。

513
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,590
Good lung sliding, no pneumo.

514
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,590
肺滑动良好，无气胸。

515
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,100
It is displacement.

516
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,100
这是移位。

517
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,640
Okay, that is\Na transected trachea.

518
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,640
好的，这是气管断裂。

519
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Pulling out.

520
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
正在拔出。

521
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,150
Bag.

522
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,150
袋子。

523
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,690
But if you intubate again,\Nwon't it just come straight

524
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,690
但如果你再插管，它不会直接从伤口出来吗？

525
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,150
- out the wound?\N- Yep, exactly.

526
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,150
- 是的，完全正确。

527
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,560
So we're gonna\Nneed another plan.

528
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,560
所以我们需要另想办法。

529
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,280
Okay. Sats down to 83.

530
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,280
好的。血氧饱和度降到 83。

531
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,780
Yeah, he's not\Nmoving any air.

532
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,780
是的，他没有呼吸。

533
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,700
Okay, I need a neonatal mask.

534
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,700
好的，我需要一个新生儿面罩。

535
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,200
- Neonatal?\N- Yep.

536
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,200
- 新生儿？- 是的。

537
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,700
I'm just going to finish\Nmy initial exam.

538
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,700
我只是要完成我的初步检查。

539
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,960
Let me know if you\Nfeel any pain, okay?

540
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,960
如果你感到任何疼痛，请告诉我，好吗？

541
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,380
My legs are fine.

542
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,380
我的腿没问题。

543
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,000
All looks good.

544
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,000
一切看起来都很好。

545
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,550
No need for X-rays\Nor advanced imaging.

546
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,550
不需要拍 X 光片或进行高级影像检查。

547
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,970
Got it.

548
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,970
明白了。

549
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,510
- Two areas of ecchymosis...\N- That means bruising.

550
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,510
- 两处淤血... - 那是指瘀伤。

551
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,180
Over the shoulders\Nbilaterally.

552
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,180
双侧肩膀上方。

553
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,890
- I'll document with photos.\N- Okay.

554
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,890
- 我会用照片记录。- 好的。

555
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,010
Dana will finish up her work,\Nand I will be in the ER

556
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,010
Dana 会完成她的工作，我会在急诊室

557
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,730
if you have any questions.

558
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,730
如果你有任何问题。

559
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,310
You're in great hands.

560
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,310
你在很好的照顾下。

561
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,890
Thank you.

562
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,890
谢谢你。

563
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,230
All right, Ilana.

564
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,230
好的，Ilana。

565
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,200
I read your intake.

566
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,200
我看过你的初诊表了。

567
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,570
Why don't you give me\Nyour description

568
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,570
你能给我讲一下

569
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,190
of exactly what happened?

570
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,190
具体发生了什么吗？

571
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:06,120
I was at\Na 4th of July barbecue

572
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:06,120
我当时在一个独立日烧烤聚会上

573
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,950
with a bunch of friends.

574
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,950
和一群朋友在一起。

575
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,750
I helped set up.

576
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,750
我帮着设置的。

577
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,590
Where does it hurt?

578
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,590
哪里疼？

579
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,060
Like here,\Nunder my belly button.

580
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,060
就在这儿，肚脐下面。

581
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,440
Okay, do you have any fever,\Nvomiting, diarrhea?

582
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,440
好的，你有发烧、呕吐或腹泻吗？

583
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,860
Oh, no.\NIt's--it's just a stomachache.

584
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,860
哦，没有。就是——就是胃疼。

585
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,150
Okay, well, still, go see\Nthe nurse and have her call me.

586
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,150
好吧，不过，还是去看看护士，让她给我打电话。

587
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,610
Okay.

588
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,610
好的。

589
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,070
But I'm still having\Nice cream tonight.

590
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,070
但我今晚还是要吃冰淇淋。

591
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,240
Why don't you see\Nhow you feel later?

592
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,240
你为什么不等等看自己感觉怎么样？

593
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,780
It--it's not bad.\NYou don't have to get so sad.

594
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,780
这——这不是什么大问题。你不必这么难过。

595
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,150
I'm not sad.\NI'm--I'm good.

596
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,150
我不难过。我——我很好。

597
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,490
Your face doesn't look good.

598
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,490
你的脸色看起来不太好。

599
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,910
Oh.

600
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,910
哦。

601
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Well, you still wanna watch\Nthe fireworks tonight?

602
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
你今晚还想看烟火吗？

603
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,370
I have our headphones--

604
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,370
我有我们的耳机——

605
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,460
- I'm not being rude.\N- Sorry, Becca. I gotta go.

606
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,460
- 我不是在无礼。- 对不起，贝卡。我得走了。

607
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,770
Elliot Green, 17, syncopal\Nepisode at football practice.

608
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,770
埃利奥特·格林，17 岁，在足球训练中晕厥发作。

609
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,640
Look, I just got dizzy, okay?

610
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,640
听着，我只是有点头晕，好吗？

611
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,220
It's hell week.\NI need to get back.

612
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,220
这是地狱周。我得回去。

613
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,980
Yeah, okay, tough guy.

614
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,980
好吧，硬汉。

615
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,980
A and O, systolic of 95, tachy\Nat 122, no meds, no allergies.

616
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,980
意识清醒，收缩压 95，心率 122，无用药史，无过敏史。

617
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,480
How long were you\Nat practice?

618
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,480
你在训练中待了多久？

619
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,980
I started at 9:00,\Nso, like, four hours.

620
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,980
我 9 点开始的，所以大概四个小时。

621
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,450
Four hours in this heat\Nwith all that gear?

622
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,450
在这种炎热中穿着全套装备四个小时？

623
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,660
No pain, no game.

624
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,660
没有痛苦，就没有游戏。

625
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,160
God, I'm hungry.

626
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,160
天哪，我饿了。

627
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,000
Hey. When's our break?\NThere's no breaks down here.

628
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,000
嘿。我们什么时候休息？这里没有休息时间。

629
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,040
Always make sure you pack\Na protein bar, something quick.

630
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,040
一定要记得带上蛋白棒，什么快速的东西都行。

631
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,970
Ogilvie, Joy,\Njump in on this.

632
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,970
奥吉尔维，乔伊，你们加入讨论一下。

633
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,470
Syncope at football practice.

634
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,470
足球训练中晕倒。

635
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,640
No, I just--\NI just needed to hydrate.

636
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,640
不，我只是——我只是需要补充水分。

637
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,010
Possible heatstroke?

638
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,010
可能是中暑？

639
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,260
Well, with heatstroke,\Nyou would have

640
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,260
好吧，中暑的话，你会有

641
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,640
an altered mental status.

642
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,640
精神状态改变。

643
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,140
And they're usually dry,\Nnot sweaty.

644
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,140
他们通常是干燥的，不会出汗。

645
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,010
Mortality is 50%,\Nespecially in the elderly.

646
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,010
死亡率为 50%，特别是在老年人中。

647
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,350
In extreme heat like this...

648
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,350
在这样的极端高温下...

649
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,780
Langdon, can you cover this?

650
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,780
兰登，你能处理这个吗？

651
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,270
- No problem.\N- Mr. Diaz. Orlando.

652
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,270
- 没问题。- 迪亚兹先生。奥兰多。

653
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,150
Orlando, where are you going?

654
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,150
奥兰多，你要去哪里？

655
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,980
- Home. Can you take these out?\N- Uh, no.

656
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,980
- 回家。你能把这些拿出去吗？- 呃，不行。

657
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,110
It takes 48 hours for you\Nto get out of DKA.

658
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,110
你需要 48 小时才能摆脱糖尿病酮症酸中毒。

659
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,910
Your blood is still\Nfull of acid.

660
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,910
你的血液中仍然充满了酸。

661
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,490
Look, I can't add\Nthousands of dollars

662
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,490
听着，我不能再加上数千美元

663
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,780
to the 100 grand I already owe.

664
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,780
到我已经欠的 10 万美元上。

665
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,710
I'm--I'm sorry.\N100 grand?

666
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,710
我——我很抱歉。10 万美元？

667
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,960
In medical debt.\NMy wife doesn't even know.

668
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,960
医疗债务。我的妻子甚至不知道。

669
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,960
I'll never be able\Nto pay it off as it is.

670
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,960
我根本无法还清。

671
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,170
Where are your wife\Nand daughter?

672
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,170
你的妻子和女儿在哪里？

673
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,630
Maybe we can all talk.

674
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,630
也许我们可以一起谈谈。

675
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,210
I told them to go back\Nto work a couple hours ago.

676
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,210
我几小时前告诉他们回去工作了。

677
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,880
But the hospital is\Ngiving you a big discount.

678
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,880
但医院给你一个很大的折扣。

679
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,670
And, Mr. Diaz,\NI know it's not ideal,

680
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,670
而且，迪亚兹先生，我知道这不是理想的情况，

681
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,430
but can you stay\Nfor at least 12 hours?

682
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,430
但你能至少待 12 个小时吗？

683
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,140
It would get you out\Nof the danger zone.

684
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,140
这样你就能脱离危险区域。

685
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,720
No. I really can't.

686
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,720
不行。我真的不能。

687
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,180
Every minute I stay is a meal,\Nshoes, school supplies.

688
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,180
我待的每一分钟都是一顿饭、一双鞋、学用品的钱。

689
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,690
Plus, I have a second job\NI have to get to by 4:00.

690
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,690
而且，我还有第二份工作要在下午 4 点前赶到。

691
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,610
- You need fluids!\N- I drink plenty of water.

692
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,610
- 你需要补充液体！- 我喝了很多水。

693
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,980
And potassium and insulin.\NOkay, how about this?

694
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,980
还有钾和胰岛素。好吧，这样怎么样？

695
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,740
You stay and I'll get together\Neverything you'll need at home.

696
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,740
你留下来，我会把你在家需要的一切都准备好。

697
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,070
Also, a referral to Northside\NChristian Health Center.

698
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,070
另外，还有转诊到北区基督教健康中心。

699
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,450
Come on.\NYou don't work until 4:00.

700
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,450
来吧。你到 4 点才上班。

701
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,160
It'll keep you from passing out\Non the job again--

702
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,160
这样你就不会再在工作中昏迷了——

703
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,490
or worse.

704
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,490
或者更糟的情况。

705
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,920
Okay, I guess.

706
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,920
好吧，我想可以。

707
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,080
Great.

708
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,080
太好了。

709
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,010
Thank you. Please.

710
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,010
谢谢你。拜托了。

711
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,880
Sats up to 98.

712
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,880
血氧饱和度达到 98。

713
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,640
- Neonatal mask is working.\N- Santos, finish the FAST.

714
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,640
- 新生儿面罩在工作。- 桑托斯，完成 FAST 检查。

715
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,930
What--what are\Nyou injecting?

716
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,930
你在注射什么？

717
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,180
Lido with epi.

718
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,180
利多卡因加肾上腺素。

719
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,680
It'll clamp off\Nany little bleeders.

720
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,680
它会止住任何小的出血点。

721
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,190
We need some skin hooks.\N4 Shiley?

722
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,190
我们需要一些皮肤钩。4 个 Shiley 的？

723
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,560
Mm, I don't like\Nthe curve of a Shiley.

724
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,560
嗯，我不喜欢 Shiley 的弧度。

725
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,230
I didn't know\Nyou were so picky.

726
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,230
我不知道你这么挑剔。

727
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,310
Santos, take a break.

728
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,310
Santos，休息一下。

729
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,440
Help me cut down a 6-0 ET tube.

730
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,440
帮我剪短一根 6-0 ET 导管。

731
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,860
What is going on here?

732
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,860
这里发生了什么？

733
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,570
You have a field medic\Nassisting you?

734
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,570
你有一名野战医疗兵在协助你？

735
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,940
Dr. Abbot is an attending,

736
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,940
Abbott 医生是主治医生，

737
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,490
and he's also a SWAT physician.

738
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,490
他也是特警队的内科医生。

739
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,660
My buddy Hiro here\Nis in bad need of an airway.

740
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,660
我的伙伴 Hiro 这里急需建立气道。

741
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,030
- Cut it right here.\N- We can do this.

742
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,030
- 就在这里剪。- 我们可以做到。

743
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,290
No, no, I got it.

744
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,290
不，不，我来。

745
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,410
You must be Gloria's new hire.

746
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,410
你一定是格洛丽亚新招的员工。

747
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,920
Yes. Dr. Al-Hashimi.

748
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,920
是的。哈希米博士。

749
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,040
Well, I'd shake your hand,\Nbut my tube is ready.

750
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,040
好吧，我想和你握手，但我的导管已经准备好了。

751
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,830
And if I could find\Nand secure the distal trachea,

752
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,830
如果我能找到并固定远端气管，

753
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,170
we have a shot at this.

754
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,170
我们就有机会了。

755
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,630
Okay, keeping\Nan eye on the sats.

756
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,630
好的，密切关注血氧饱和度。

757
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,750
Slow is smooth.\NSmooth is fast.

758
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,750
慢即是稳。稳即是快。

759
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,130
You know, you can call me\Njust to say hi sometimes.

760
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,130
你知道，有时候你可以打电话给我，只是为了打个招呼。

761
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,430
What's up now?

762
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,430
现在怎么样？

763
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,970
GSW with tracheal\Ntransection.

764
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,970
枪伤伴气管断裂。

765
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,350
Very retracted,\Nbut I think I can get it.

766
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,350
收缩很明显，但我认为我能处理。

767
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,100
Both lungs are up?

768
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,100
两个肺都上来了？

769
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,470
- Sats down to 91.\N- Scanning the belly now.

770
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,470
- 血氧饱和度降到 91。- 现在在扫描腹部。

771
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,060
Okay.

772
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,060
好的。

773
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,360
I got it. I got it.

774
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,360
我明白了。我明白了。

775
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,200
Gently, gently,\Nor we're gonna lose it.

776
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,200
轻一点，轻一点，否则我们会失去它。

777
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,030
Down to 89.

778
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,030
降到 89。

779
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,200
Oh, no.

780
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,200
哦，不。

781
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,240
I'm in. Balloon up.

782
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,240
我进去了。充气球。

783
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,790
End tidal,\Nexcellent wave form.

784
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,790
呼气末，波形很好。

785
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,960
Good breath sounds.

786
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,960
呼吸音良好。

787
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,460
I'll sew the tracheal\Nto the skin, 2-0 silk.

788
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,460
我会用 2-0 丝线将气管缝到皮肤上。

789
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,180
- Sats are coming up.\N- Whoo.

790
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,180
- 血氧饱和度在上升。- 哇。

791
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,640
Not bad, Abbot.

792
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,640
不错，艾博特。

793
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,760
Mm, while you were playing\Nwith that airway,

794
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,760
嗯，当你在处理那条气道的时候，

795
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
you missed a big bruise\Nin the left upper quadrant.

796
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
你错过了左上象限的一个大淤伤。

797
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,270
He was wearing body armor.

798
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,270
他穿着防具。

799
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,520
High-velocity projectile\Ndoesn't have

800
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,520
高速射弹没有

801
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,560
to penetrate to damage.

802
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,560
穿透造成损伤。

803
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,020
There's no fluid\Nin the suprasplenic space.

804
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,020
脾上间隙没有液体。

805
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,230
Let me look.

806
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,230
让我看看。

807
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,520
Okay, right there.

808
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,520
好的，就在那里。

809
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,110
Looks like a subcapsular\Nhematoma of his spleen.

810
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,110
看起来是他脾脏的被膜下血肿。

811
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,650
Must have been a big impact.

812
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,650
肯定造成了很大的冲击。

813

Yep, just as soon\Nas we secure this tube.

820
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,960
是的，我们一固定好这根导管就马上做。

821

瞳孔 4 毫米，有反应。

825
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,590
Did you get tackled today?

826
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,590
你今天被铲倒了吗？

827
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,010
No, just running drills.

828
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,010
没有，只是在做训练。

829
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,930
Any chest pain?\NPalpitations?

830
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,930
有胸痛吗？心悸？

831
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,260
No.

832
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,260
不行。

833
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,630
Hands off, please,\Nrunning the 12 lead.

834
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,630
请不要碰，正在做 12 导联心电图。

835
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,140
How are we looking?

836
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,140
情况怎么样？

837
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,760
Good. Healthy kid.

838
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,760
很好。孩子很健康。

No history, no trauma.

840
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,270
没有病史，没有外伤。

Differential for syncope\Nin an adolescent?

842
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,230

848
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,230
- 脓毒症。 - 或 Brugada 综合征。

849
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,530
Uh, Brugada is more\Ncommon in Asian males.

850
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,530
嗯，Brugada 综合征在亚洲男性中更常见。

851
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,030
But still\Nshould be considered.

852
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,030
但仍然应该考虑。

853
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,530
Long odds, though.

854
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,530
概率很低，不过。

855
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,450
Brugada prevalence is\N1 in 20,000 in North America,

856
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,450
布鲁加达综合征在北美的患病率为 1/20,000，

在亚洲和中东地区高达 1/300。

859
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,620
And?

860
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,620
那又怎样？

861
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,790
First described in 1992,\Nhas a high incidence

862
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,790
首次在 1992 年被描述，在心脏结构正常的年轻患者中突然死亡的发生率很高

863
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,660
of sudden death among\Nyoung patients with otherwise

864
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,660
- 结构正常的心脏-- - 哎呀，哎呀，等等。

865
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,170
- structurally normal hearts--\N- Oof, oof, wait.

866
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,170
你刚才说"突然死亡"吗？

867
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,790
Did you just say\N"sudden death"?

868
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,790
体温是 102.5。

869
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,260
Temp is 102.5.

870
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,260
Temp is 102.5.

871
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,670
Sorry, our student doctors\Nare discussing

872
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,670
抱歉，我们的学生医生在讨论

873
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,180
a rare condition\Nyou don't have.

874
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,180
一种你没有的罕见病。

875
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,390
I--I just didn't\Ndrink enough water.

876
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,390
我——我只是没有喝足够的水。

877
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,390
I overheated.

878
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,390
我过热了。

879
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,930
Not my type, bud.

880
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,930
不是我的菜，伙计。

881
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,190
Other than standard labs,\Nwhat else to order?

882
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,190
除了标准检查外，还需要检查什么？

883
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,440
CK to rule out rhabdo.

884
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,440
肌酸激酶检查以排除横纹肌溶解症。

885
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,690
To make sure you don't have

886
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,690
确保你没有

887
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,240
any muscle breakdown\Nfrom the heat.

888
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,240
因高温导致的肌肉分解。

889
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Let's set up a cooling room\Nfor Elliot here

890
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
我们为埃利奥特在这里设置一个降温室吧

891
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,700
and the other heat exhaustions\Nwe'll inevitably get today.

892
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,700
以及我们今天不可避免会遭遇的其他热衰竭。

893
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,040
Last photo.

894
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,040
最后一张照片。

895
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,120
Okay.

896
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,120
好的。

897
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,380
We'll take the SD card\Nand seal it

898
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,380
我们会取出 SD 卡并将其密封

899
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,670
in an evidence envelope\Nwith everything else.

900
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,670
放入证物信封，和其他物品一起。

901
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,050
Okay.

902
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,050
好的。

903
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,010
Next, Emma's gonna\Nturn off the light,

904
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,010
接下来，艾玛会关掉灯，

905
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,520
and I'll run a blue light\Nover your skin.

906
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,520
我会用蓝光照射你的皮肤。

907
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,150
Anything glows, I'll swab it\Nwith a wet, then dry Q-tip.

908
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,150
如果有任何地方发光，我会用湿的棉签擦拭，然后用干棉签擦干。

909
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,400
Is that okay?

910
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,400
可以吗？

911
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,610
Yeah, sure.

912
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,610
好的，没问题。

913
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,240
All right.

914
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,240
好的。

915
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,360
Take off your gown\Non the left side

916
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,360
把你左边的衣服脱掉

917
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:59,120
and turn a little bit\Ntowards me, just to the left.

918
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:59,120
稍微转向我这边，向左一点。

919
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,500
There.

920
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,500
好的。

921
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,690
Something on the left wrist.

922
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,690
左腕上有什么东西。

923
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,940
Swab.

924
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,940
擦拭。

925
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,280
Sorry.

926
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,280
抱歉。

927
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,610
Don't be.

928
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,610
别紧张。

929
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,410
- It's just cold.\N- Yeah.

930
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,410
- 只是冷。- 是的。

931
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,240
Almost done.

932
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,240
快完成了。

933
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,750
- Thanks, Antoine.\N- No problem.

934
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,750
- 谢谢你，安托万。- 没问题。

935
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,370
Keep your head down out there.

936
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,370
在外面保持低调。

937
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,920
What's the story?

938
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,920
怎么回事？

939
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,500
Neck angio is negative,\Nmissed the carotids.

940
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,500
颈部血管造影阴性，漏掉了颈动脉。

941
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,300
- He's lucky.\N- What about the belly?

942
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,300
- 他很幸运。- 腹部怎么样？

943
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,180
Small splenic injury,\Nno free fluid in the abdomen.

944
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,180
脾脏轻微损伤，腹腔内无游离液体。

945
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,050
- That should heal on its own.\N- What's the plan?

946
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,050
- 那应该会自行愈合。- 计划是什么？

947
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,520
Head and Neck will have\Nan OR ready

948
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,520
头颈外科会准备好手术室

949
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,850
with thoracic standing by.

950
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,850
胸外科待命。

951
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,560
How soon can they take him?

952
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,560
他们什么时候能接收他？

953
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,100
We're a little backed up\Nwith Westbridge patients,

954
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,100
我们现在韦斯特布里奇的患者有点多，

955
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,360
but let's bring him up.

956
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,360
但让我们把他送上来。

957
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,860
I'll get him\Ntaken care of for you.

958
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,860
我会为你照顾好他。

959
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,480
Hey.

960
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,480
嘿。

961
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,620
You're gonna be okay, Hiro.\NWe're getting you to surgery.

962
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,620
你会没事的，希罗。我们要给你做手术。

963
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,780
I'll write\Nthe procedure note.

964
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,780
我来写手术记录。

965
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,990
Thank you.

966
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,990
谢谢你。

967
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,030
SWAT? Really?

968
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,030
特警队？真的吗？

969
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,040
I suck at golf.

970
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,040
我高尔夫球打得很烂。

971
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,370
You spend time\Nin the Middle East?

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,960
More than I would have liked.

974
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,960
比我想象的要长。

975
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,790
I worked in Kabul\Nwith Médecins Sans Frontières

976
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,790
我曾在喀布尔为无国界医生组织工作

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,220
悲剧。

985
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,480
We should grab a beer sometime,\Nshare war stories.

986
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,480
我们应该找个时间喝啤酒，分享战争故事。

987
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,650
I'd like that.

988
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,650
我很乐意。

989
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,570
She seems cool.

990
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,570
她看起来不错。

991
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,150
Yep, maybe.

992
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,150
是的，也许吧。

993
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,860
I'm not gonna be around\Nlong enough to find out.

994
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,860
我不会在这里呆足够长的时间来找出答案。

995
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,120
Oh, there she is! Vic!

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,880
别告诉你妈妈。开玩笑的。

1005
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,210
But seriously, don't.

1006

那是——我——我很确定

1027
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,640
I was just trying\Nto stay out of the way.

1028
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,640
我只是想不碍事。

1029
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,980
Ah, she's modest,\Nlike her dad.

1030
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,980
啊，她很谦虚，像她爸爸一样。

1031
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,810
And her mother?

1032
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,810
她的母亲呢？

1033
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,030

You know Mom really wants me\Nto go into surgery.

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,340
你知道妈妈真的想让我去做手术。

1057
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,180
Ah, your mom wants me\Nto stop drinking

00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,640
I will risk an Achilles tear\Nbefore I give up scotch.

1064
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,640
我宁愿冒着跟腱撕裂的风险也不会放弃威士忌。

1065
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,730
Hey, I hope I didn't\Nembarrass you coming down here.

I'm still not sure.

1078
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,780
我仍然不确定。

1079
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,530

You don't know the half of it.

1088
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,160
你根本不知道我有多厉害。

1089
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,340

00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,920
很高的标准要达到。

1093
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,710
Oh, you don't know\Nthe half of it.

1095
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,970
Mr. and Mrs. Davis, this is\NDr. Jefferson from Psychiatry.

1096
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,970
戴维斯先生和太太，我是精神科的杰斐逊医生。

Can you tell us what's\Ngoing on with our son?

1100
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,270
你们能告诉我们你们儿子怎么了吗？

1101
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,100
All of his labs\Nand X-rays came back normal.

1102
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,100
他的所有检查和 X 光片结果都正常。

1103
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,770
Given his age\Nand his hearing voices,

1104
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,770
考虑到他的年龄和他听到声音的情况，

1105
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,480
do either of you have a family\Nhistory of mental illness?

1106
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,480
你们中有人有精神疾病的家族史吗？

1107
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,990
Not mine.

1108
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,990
我没有。

1109
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,420
My brother took his own life.

1110
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,420
我哥哥自杀了。

1111
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,780
Wait, what?

1112
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,780
等等，什么？

1113
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,000
Uncle Ken?

1114
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,000
肯叔叔？

1115
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,870
You said he drank\Nhimself to death.

1116
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,870
你说他喝酒喝死了。

1117
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,710
- Ma.\N- He did that too.

1118
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,710
- 妈妈。- 他也确实这样做了。

1119
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,000
Was he ever\Nformally diagnosed

1120
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,000
他是否曾被正式诊断过

1121
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,220
with a mental health issue?

1122
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,220
患有心理健康问题？

1123
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,510
No.

1124
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,510
不行。

1125
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,590
He was depressed,\Nhad mood swings.

1126

1127
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,390
- But he didn't wanna see anyone.\N- Oh, my God.

1128
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,390
- 但他不想见任何人。- 天哪。

1129
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,560
Okay, why am I just now\Nhearing about this?

1130
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,560
好吧，我为什么现在才听说这件事？

1131
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,930
- Jada, please.\N- Please what, Mom?

1132
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,930
- 杰达，拜托。- 拜托什么，妈妈？

1133
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,900
Why would you not\Ntell Jackson or me?

1134
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,900
你为什么不告诉杰克逊或我？

1135
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,360
I can't believe this.

1136
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,360
我简直不敢相信。

1137
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,110
- Jada.\N- Excuse me.

1138
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,110
- 杰达。- 打扰一下。

1139
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,270
Jada.

1140
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,270
杰达。

1141
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,610
What happens next?

1142
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,610
接下来会怎样？

1143
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,040
We keep your son here\Nfor the next three days

1144
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,040
我们会让你的儿子在这里待三天

1145
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,040
for observation and therapy.

1146
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,040
进行观察和治疗。

1147
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,660
And that will help us\Nto understand what is going on.

1148
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,660
这样会帮助我们理解发生了什么。

1149
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,170
Jada should really hear this.

1150
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,170
杰达真的应该听听这个。

1151
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,040
Let me see if I can find her,\Nbring her back.

1152
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,040
让我看看我能不能找到她，把她带回来。

1153
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,130
Okay.\NI'm gonna swab your mouth now.

1154
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,130
好的。我现在要给你的嘴里取样。

1155
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,850
My mouth?

1156
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,850
我的嘴？

1157
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,850
Two dry swabs along\Nthe inside of your cheek

1158
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,850
用两根干棉签沿着你的脸颊内侧擦拭

1159
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,970
and then along the gum line.

1160
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,970
然后沿着牙龈线擦拭。

1161
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,650
How you feeling?

1162
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,650
你感觉怎么样？

1163
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,230
I wish this day\Nnever happened.

1164
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,230
我希望这一天从未发生过。

1165
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,280
Would you like some medicine\Nto help you relax?

1166
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,280
你想要一些药物来帮助你放松吗？

1167
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,530
You've experienced\Na horrific trauma.

1168
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,530
你经历过可怕的创伤。

1169
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,870
You've been\Ndoing this a while?

1170
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,870
你做这个有一段时间了？

1171
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,370
Let's just say\NFlorence Nightingale

1172
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,370
就说我和弗洛伦斯·南丁格尔

1173
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,370
and I were roommates.

1174
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,370
是室友吧。

1175
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,910
Who?

1176
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,910
谁？

1177
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,460
I rest my case.

1178
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,460
我的论证到此结束。

1179
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,790
She was the founder\Nof modern nursing.

1180
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,790
她是现代护理学的创始人。

1181
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,000
Okay, you can have something\Nto eat or drink now.

1182
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,000
好的，你现在可以吃点东西或喝点饮料了。

1183
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,050
- I'm fine.\N- Are you sure?

1184
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,050
- 我很好。- 你确定吗？

1185
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,840
I'll just keep going.

1186
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,840
我会继续坚持下去。

1187
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,890
Okay.

1188
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,890
好的。

1189
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,310
We now have a heat exhaustion\Ntreatment area in North 5.

1190
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,310
我们现在在北 5 区有了一个热衰竭治疗区。

1191
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,820
Evaporated cooling.\NGreat plan.

1192
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,820
蒸发冷却。很好的计划。

1193
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,530
Yeah, it was\NDr. Langdon's idea.

1194
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,530
是的，这是兰登医生的主意。

1195
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,450
He figured we'd be seeing a lot\Nmore patients in this heat.

1196
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,450
他认为在这种炎热的天气里我们会看到更多的患者。

1197
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,200
He's right.

1198
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,200
他说得对。

1199
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,420
How are you feeling?

1200
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,420
你感觉怎么样？

1201
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,920
That's a loaded question.

1202
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,920
这是个很难回答的问题。

1203
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,960
It wasn't meant to be.

1204
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,960
我没有那个意思。

1205
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,210
You have a deposition\Nin a couple of hours?

1206
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,210
你几小时后要去作证？

1207
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,460
- Yes.\N- How are you feeling about it?

1208
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,460
- 是的。- 你感觉怎么样？

1209
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,550
Um, trying\Nto think positively

1210
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,550
嗯，我在尽力往积极的方面想。

1211
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,630
but feeling, um, less so.

1212
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,630
但感觉上，嗯，没那么多。

1213
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,930
This job's really important\Nto me and my sister.

1214
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,930
这份工作对我和我妹妹来说真的很重要。

1215
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,510
You know, I support both of us.

1216
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,510
你知道，我支持我们两个。

1217
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,560
It's gonna go great.

1218
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,560
一切都会很顺利的。

1219
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,230
Just tell them what happened.

1220
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,230
就告诉他们发生了什么。

1221
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,810
You're not at fault.\NYour job's not in jeopardy.

1222
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,810
这不是你的错。你的工作不会有危险。

1223
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,890
I mean, the lawyers\Nsaid that I could--

1224
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,890
我是说，律师们说我可以——

1225
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,070
The lawyers' job is to try\Nand shake your confidence.

1226
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,070
律师的工作就是试图动摇你的信心。

1227
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,490
So don't let them.\NYou're a very good doctor.

1228
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,490
所以别让他们得逞。你是一位非常优秀的医生。

1229
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,660
I have been training\Nresidents for years.

1230
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,660
我已经培训住院医生多年了。

1231
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,360
You are one of the very best.

1232
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,360
你是最优秀的人之一。

1233
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,660
I am?

1234
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,660
我是吗？

1235
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,830
No, we need\Nto stick to the plan.

1236
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,830
不，我们需要坚持计划。

1237
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,990
- I promise.\N- Look.

1238
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,990
- 我保证。- 看。

1239
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,200
Thanks.

1240
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,200
谢谢。

1241
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,530
She's not thinking\Nclearly, okay?

1242
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,530
她现在思路不清楚，好吗？

1243
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,660
It's gonna be great.

1244
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,660
这会很棒的。

1245
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,990
This is not what she wants.

1246
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,990
这不是她想要的。

1247
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,790
Then I'm taking her home.\NThat's it.

1248
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,790
那我就带她回家。就这样。

1249
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,830
We have to honor\Nyour wife's wishes.

1250
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,830
我们必须尊重你妻子的意愿。

1251
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,340
Even if she's\Nloaded up on morphine

1252
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,340
即使她注射了大量吗啡

1253
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,170
- and can't think straight?\N- Especially then.

1254
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,170
- 神志不清？ - 尤其是那时候。

1255
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,710
Hello.

1256
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,710
你好。

1257
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Paul Hamler, this is\Nmy attending, Dr. Robinavitch.

1258
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
我是保罗·哈姆勒，这是我的主治医生罗宾诺维奇医生。

1259
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,170
- Hi.\N- Hi.

1260
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,170
- 你好。 - 你好。

1261
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,680
Uh, my wife is not\Nthinking clearly.

1262
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,680
嗯，我妻子思路不清。

1263
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,220
What is it that\Nshe's asking for?

1264
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,220
她要求什么？

1265
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,470
Said she wants to stay here.

1266
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,470
她说她想留在这里。

1267
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,520
Why don't we all\Ngo in and talk?

1268
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,520
我们为什么不都进去谈谈？

1269
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,770
Brian Jenkins is\Nallowed to hunt with a .22

1270
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,770
布莱恩·詹金斯被允许用.22 口径枪狩猎。

1271
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,230
on his grandpa's farm.

1272
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,230
在他爷爷的农场上。

1273
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,270
Sounds like an accident\Njust waiting to happen.

1274
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,270
听起来像是一场随时都会发生的事故。

1275
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,820
Mm-hmm.\NAnd you're not Brian Jenkins.

1276
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,820
嗯。而且你不是布莱恩·詹金斯。

1277
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,570
How are we doing\Nin here, Roxie?

1278
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,570
我们在这里进展如何，罗克西？

1279
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,190
Been better.

1280
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,190
还可以。

1281
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,820
Rumor has it\Nyou're still interested

1282
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,820
听说你还有兴趣

1283
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,250
in booking a room with us?

1284
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,250
在我们这儿订个房间？

1285
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,460
I don't wanna\Ngo back home yet.

1286
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,460
我还不想回家。

1287
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,830
It's all set up, Rox.

1288
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,830
一切都安排好了，罗克丝。

1289
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,040
You're gonna be\Nmore comfortable at home.

1290
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,040
你在家会更舒服。

1291
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,290
Paul, I changed my mind.

1292
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,290
保罗，我改主意了。

1293
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,760
It is our home.

1294
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,760
这是我们的家。

1295
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,460
I don't--

1296
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,460
我不——

1297
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,300
I don't want you\Nliving with my ghost.

1298
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,300
我不想让你和我的幽灵一起生活。

1299
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,260
I will happily\Nlive with your ghost.

1300
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,260
我很乐意和你的幽灵一起生活。

1301
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,840
Can we just all stop\Ntalking about ghosts, please?

1302
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,840
我们能都别再谈论鬼魂了吗？拜托了。

1303
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,060
Yes. I'm sorry.

1304
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,060
好的。我很抱歉。

1305
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,810
I'm sorry, sweetie.\NYou're right.

1306
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,810
我很抱歉，亲爱的。你说得对。

1307
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,810
Got trauma flying in.\NETA, five minutes.

1308
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,810
有创伤患者即将到达。预计到达时间，五分钟。

1309
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,030
Okay.\NUm, I'm very sorry.

1310
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,030
好的。嗯，我非常抱歉。

1311
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,570
I will be right back.

1312
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,570
我马上回来。

1313
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,900
Excuse me.

1314
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,900
对不起。

1315
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,320
It's a boating accident,\Nswimmer versus propeller.

1316
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,320
这是一起划船事故，游泳者与螺旋桨相撞。

1317
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,650
Ouch.

1318
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,650
哎哟。

1319
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,330
- What body parts involved?\N- They didn't say.

1320
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,330
- 涉及身体的哪些部位？- 他们没有说。

1321
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,830
- How old?\N- Nope.

1322
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,830
- 多大了？- 没有。

1323
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,080
Anything?

1324
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,080
有什么线索吗？

1325
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,580
All I got was\Nboating accident,

1326
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,580
我只知道是一起划船事故，

1327
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,620
- swimmer versus propeller.\N- Propeller. Got it.

1328
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,620
- 游泳者对上螺旋桨。- 螺旋桨。明白了。

1329
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,790
Picked a hell of a day\Nto come back, huh?

1330
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,790
选了个该死的日子回来，嗯？

1331
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,740
How's Jake?

1332
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,740
杰克怎么样？

1333
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,450
He's good.

1334
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,450
他很好。

1335
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,620
He's better. He's coping.

1336
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,620
他更好了。他在应对得很好。

1337
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,740
He's gonna be\Na senior this fall.

1338
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,740
他今年秋天就要成为大四学生了。

1339
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,170
That's great.

1340
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,170
那太好了。

1341
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,340
That was a lot\Nfor him to go through.

1342
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,340
他经历了很多。

1343
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,420
A lot for all of us\Nto go through.

1344
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,420
我们都经历了很多。

1345
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,930
Yeah.

1346
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,930
好的。

1347
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,510
Okay, I'm just gonna say it!

1348
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,510
好吧，我就直说了！

1349
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,970
I'm sorry.

1350
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,970
我很抱歉。

1351
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,590
I betrayed your trust.

1352
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,590
我背叛了你的信任。

1353
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,600
I betrayed our patients' trust.

1354
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,600
我背叛了我们患者的信任。

1355
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,930
And I'm really fucking sorry.

1356
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,930
我真的非常抱歉。

1357
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,400
It'll never happen again,\NI swear.

1358
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,400
我发誓这种事再也不会发生。

1359
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,320
I'm really glad that you\Ngot the help that you need.

1360
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,320
我真的很高兴你得到了你需要的帮助。

1361
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,740
But I don't know if\NI want you working in my ER.

1362
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,740
但我不确定是否想让你在我的急诊室工作。

1363
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,920
Why'd you intubate him?

1364
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,920
你为什么给他插管？

1365
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,290
He was splinting\Nfrom the pain,

1366
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,290
他因为疼痛而肌肉僵硬，

1367
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,880
barely moving air\Nwith sats in the 80s.

1368
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,880
气流流动很少，血氧饱和度只有 80 多。

1369
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,250
How'd he get sliced up\Nin the propeller?

1370
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,250
他怎么被螺旋桨割伤的？

1371
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,630
He was in the Allegheny

1372
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,630
他在阿勒格尼河里

1373
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,050
trying to untangle\Na water ski tow line

1374
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,050
试图解开水上滑雪拖绳

1375
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,130
when his buddy\Nstarted the engine.

1376
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,130
这时他的伙伴启动了引擎。

1377
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,350
Drunk buddy, I assume?

1378
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,350
我猜是醉酒的伙伴？

1379
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,810
Well, it's 4th of July.\NYou tell me.

1380
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,810
嗯，今天是 7 月 4 日。你自己判断吧。

1381
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,180
Focus on the patient, please.

1382
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,180
请专注于患者，谢谢。

1383
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,300
Sofie, take over bagging.

1384
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,300
索菲，你来负责装袋。

1385
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,440
Okay. One, two, three.

1386
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,440
好的。一、二、三。

1387
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,650
Watch that buckle.

1388
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,650
小心那个扣子。

1389
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,230
- Do you need me in here?\N- Nope.

1390
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,230
- 你需要我在这儿吗？- 不用。

1391
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,950
We have a senior resident\Nand an attending.

1392
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,950
我们有一位资深住院医生和一位主治医生。

1393
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,240
Mel, can we start with a--

1394
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,240
梅尔，我们能从——开始吗？

1395
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,820
- An EFAST? Sure.\N- Yes, please.

1396
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,820
- 做 EFAST 检查？当然可以。- 好的，谢谢。

1397
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,320
Why?

1398
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,320
为什么？

1399
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,790
To check and make sure\Nthere's no pneumothorax.

1400
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,790
检查并确保没有气胸。

1401
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,500
Otherwise, it could\Nbecome a tension.

1402
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,500
否则，可能会引发紧张局面。

1403
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,120
Exactly. Oh, wow.

1404
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,120
完全同意。哇。

1405
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,370
- You want O-neg?\N- Not without a BP first.

1406
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,370
- 你要 O 阴性血？ - 先量血压再说。

1407
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,420
108/64, pulse is 102.

1408
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,420
血压 108/64，脉搏 102。

1409
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,670
- Sats are good.\N- Okay, let's have O-neg ready,

1410
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,670
- 血氧饱和度很好。 - 好的，准备好 O 阴性血，

1411
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,840
- but don't give it just yet.\N- Anything else?

1412
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,840
- 但先别给。- 还有别的吗？

1413
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,550
How about a hemocue?

1414
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,550
血红蛋白仪怎么样？

1415
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,840
Uh, yeah.\NYeah, yeah, of course.

1416
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,840
嗯，好的。好的，好的，当然。

1417
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,600
Next step is fingernails.

1418
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,600
下一步是指甲。

1419
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,570
We'll go under each nail,

1420
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,570
我们会检查每个指甲下面，

1421
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,030
first with the wet swab\Nand then with the dry one.

1422
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,030
先用湿棉签，然后用干棉签。

1423
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,570
Do you wanna take a break, hon?

1424
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,570
你想休息一下吗，亲爱的？

1425
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,450
No.

1426
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,450
不行。

1427
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,420
How much longer?

1428
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,420
还要多久？

1429
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,210
After these,\Nwe'll get to external...

1430
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,210
这些之后，我们会进行外部采集...

1431
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,420
And internal\Nvaginal collection.

1432
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,420
以及内部阴道采集。

1433
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,510
It's the advocate from PAAR.

1434
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,510
这是来自 PAAR 的倡导者。

1435
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,180
They've been doing this\Nlonger than I have.

1436
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,180
他们从事这项工作的时间比我长。

1437
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,550
They provide resources,\Nassistance, and support

1438
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,550
他们提供资源、协助和支持

1439
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,520
for sexual assault survivors.

1440
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,520
给性暴力幸存者。

1441
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,400
Hey.

1442
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,400
嘿。

1443
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,690
This will not define you, okay?

1444
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,690
这不会定义你，好吗？

1445
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,520
You don't have to talk to them,\Nbut I recommend you do.

1446
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,520
你不必和他们交谈，但我建议你这样做。

1447
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,610
They're available 24/7.

1448
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,610
他们全天候 24 小时提供服务。

1449
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,710
- Okay.\N- Okay.

1450
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,710
- 好的。- 好的。

1451
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,300
Hi.

1452

嗨。

1453
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,630
I'm Paulette Sanderson from\NPittsburgh Action Against Rape.

1454
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,630
我是来自匹兹堡反强奸行动组织的保莱特·桑德森。

1455
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,800
Hi, Paulette.\NI'm the SANE, Dana.

1456
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,800
嗨，波莱特。我是 SANE 的达娜。

1457
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,800
- And this is Ilana.\N- Hello.

1458
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,800
- 这是伊拉娜。- 你好。

1459
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,300
I'm sorry to meet you\Nunder these circumstances,

1460
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,300
很遗憾在这样的情况下认识你，

1461
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,470
but I and my organization\Nare here to help you navigate

1462
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,470
但我和我的组织在这里帮助你应对

1463
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,430
everything that comes next.

1464
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,430
接下来发生的一切。

1465
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,510
I brought you some clothes\Nand basic necessities.

1466
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,510
我给你带了一些衣服和日用必需品。

1467
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,140
I can even stay with you\Nthrough the rest

1468
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,140
如果你愿意，我甚至可以陪你完成剩下的

1469
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,520
of your examination\Nif you'd like.

1470
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,520
检查。

1471
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,150
I don't think\Nthat's necessary.

1472
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,150
我认为没有必要。

1473
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,650
- Okay.\N- That's fine.

1474
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,650
- 好的。- 没问题。

1475
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,530
Would it be okay if\NI asked you a few questions?

1476
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,530
我能问你几个问题吗？

1477
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,210
Sure.

1478
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,210
当然可以。

1479
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,920
Mm, our VRI isn't working.

1480
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,920
嗯，我们的 VRI 坏了。

1481
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,680
Video Relay Interpreter?

1482
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,680
视频远程传译员？

1483
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,220
Yeah, of course I rebooted it.

1484
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,220
是的，当然我重启过了。

1485
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,890
Wait, how are you gonna\Nfix it if you don't know

1486
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,890
等等，你不知道的话怎么修呢

1487
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,010
what the hell it is?

1488
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,010
这到底是什么？

1489
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,190
Yeah, okay.\NWhatever.

1490
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,190
好吧，随便。

1491
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,230
I wanna do a head\Nand belly scan on Harlow.

1492
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,230
我想给哈洛做头部和腹部扫描。

1493
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,520
Can you try telling her why?

1494
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,520
你能试着告诉她原因吗？

1495
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,730
What about the VRI?

1496
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,730
VRI 呢？

1497
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,600
It's DOA.

1498
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,600
它已经死了。

1499
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,610
I'm charting every\Nfree minute I get.

1500
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,610
我在利用每一分钟空闲时间做图表。

1501
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,440
I wasn't coming over\Nfor that.

1502
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,440
我不是为了那个才过来的。

1503
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,370
Good job in the Trauma earlier.

1504
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,370
你之前在创伤科的表现不错。

1505
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,530
What's this?

1506
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,530
这是什么？

1507
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,750
Daniel Scott, 32,

1508
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,750
丹尼尔·斯科特，32 岁，

1509
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,540
weak and dizzy\Nwhile washing his car.

1510
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,540
洗车时感到虚弱和头晕。

1511
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,040
Tachy at 106, BP 90/60.

1512
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,040
心率 106 次/分，血压 90/60。

1513
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,500
Temp's too high to register.

1514
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,500
体温高到无法测量。

1515
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,120
We have a cooling room\Nset up in North 5.

1516
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,120
我们在北 5 区设置了一个降温室。

1517
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,380
Okay, how are you\Nfeeling, Mr. Scott?

1518
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,380
好的，斯科特先生，你感觉怎么样？

1519
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,540
Thirsty.

1520
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,540
口渴。

1521
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,920
Let's see if\Nwe can't fix that.

1522
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,920
让我们看看能否解决这个问题。

1523
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,880
He's gonna need a core temp,\Na CMP--whoa.

1524
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,880
他需要测核心体温、综合代谢面板——哇。

1525
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,420
Oh, hey, we need\Na trauma room.

1526
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,420
哦，嘿，我们需要一间创伤室。

1527
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,680
- What's open?\N- 2.

1528
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,680
- 什么开放了？- 2。

1529
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,220
I'll grab the Ativan.

1530
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,220
我去拿阿替唑仑。

1531
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,840
- Any past medical history?\N- No.

1532
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,840
- 有既往病史吗？- 没有。

1533
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,720
Wife says he's healthy.\NNo meds, no allergies.

1534
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,720
妻子说他很健康。没有用药，没有过敏。

1535
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,550
He needs a core temp.

1536
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,550
他需要测核心体温。

1537
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,060
Ready to transfer.

1538
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,060
准备转移。

1539
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,360
Let's give 2 of Ativan.

1540
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,360
给他用 2 单位的阿提万。

1541
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,820
Don't want him seizing again.

1542
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,820
不想让他再发作。

1543
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,110
I gotta get back\Nto my patients.

1544
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,110
我得回去看我的病人。

1545
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,110
Okay.

1546
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,110
好的。

1547
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,860
One, two, three.

1548
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,860
一、二、三。

1549
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,910
Orders?

1550
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,910
有什么医嘱吗？

1551
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,030
Second IV with saline open.

1552
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,030
第二条生理盐水静脉通路已开放。

1553
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,420

1554
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,420

1555
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,490
I don't see any\Napparent trauma.

1556
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,490
我没有看到任何明显的外伤。

1557
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,750
- Pupils reactive.\N- Mr. Scott? Daniel?

1558
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,750
- 瞳孔有反应。- Scott 先生？Daniel？

1559
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,290
Can you talk to me?

1560
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,290
你能和我说话吗？

1561
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,050
Post-ictal,\Nbut moving all extremities.

1562
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,050
癫痫发作后，但四肢活动正常。

1563
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,970
Pulse 137, BP 88/60.

1564
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,970
脉搏 137，血压 88/60。

1565
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,590
What are you thinking,\NDr. Santos?

1566
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,590
你怎么看，桑托斯医生？

1567
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,760
Uh, heat stroke,\Nbut consider sepsis or drugs.

1568
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,760
嗯，热射病，但要考虑败血症或药物。

1569
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,520
Rectal temp is 104.6.

1570
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,520
直肠温度 104.6。

1571
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
All right, let's start\Nwith four ice packs

1572
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
好的，我们先用四个冰袋

1573
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,400
on the groin and axilla.

1574
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,400
放在腹股沟和腋窝。

1575
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,280
Should we do\Na full body ice bath?

1576
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,280
我们应该做全身冰浴吗？

1577
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,740
That'll take too long.\NDo you have an Arctic Sun?

1578
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,740
那样太费时间了。你们有极地太阳降温仪吗？

1579
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,110
Yeah, we do.

1580
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,110
有的。

1581
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,780
Get pads on the chest,\Nabdomen, and both legs.

1582
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,780
在胸部、腹部和两条腿上贴上垫片。

1583
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,490
I'll check back in.

1584
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,490
我待会儿再来检查。

1585
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,410
Ceftazidime is up,\Nand first hemoglobin, 8.2.

1586
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,410
头孢他啶已准备好，首次血红蛋白值为 8.2。

1587
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,240
8 is pretty low.\NHe must have bled down from 14.

1588
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,240
8 相当低。他的血红蛋白一定是从 14 下降的。

1589
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,870
Anything you\Nwanna do about that?

1590
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,870
你想对此采取什么措施吗？

1591
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,880
Um, young, healthy guy.\NWe transfuse at 7.

1592
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,880
嗯，年轻、身体健康的家伙。我们在 7 时输血。

1593
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,380
Do we?

1594
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,380
我们会吗？

1595
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,090
We'd be in real trouble\Nif he equilibrates

1596
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,090
如果他达到平衡，我们就真的麻烦了

1597
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,170
- from acute blood loss.\N- Am I interrupting something?

1598
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,170
- 来自急性失血。- 我打扰你们了吗？

1599
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,850
- Multiple deep lacerations--\N- Motorboat versus--

1600
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,850
- 多处深裂伤-- - 摩托艇对--

1601
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,890
Jesus.

1602
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,890
天哪。

1603
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,560
This looks like some\N"Jurassic Park" shit.

1604
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,560
这看起来像某种《侏罗纪公园》的鬼东西。

1605
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,730
Is that your official\Nsurgical diagnosis?

1606
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,730
这是你的正式手术诊断吗？

1607
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,230
He is hemodynamically stable.

1608
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,230
他血流动力学稳定。

1609
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,560
What else do we know?

1610
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,560
我们还知道什么？

1611
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,310
Uh, intubated in the field\Ndue to poor tidal volume.

1612
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,310
嗯，由于潮气量不足，在现场进行了气管插管。

1613
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,570
EFAST was negative\Nfor pneumothorax,

1614
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,570
EFAST 检查未发现气胸，

1615
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,070
so no need to do a chest tube.

1616
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,070
所以无需放置胸管。

1617
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,740
And no free fluid\Nin the abdomen,

1618
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,740
腹部无游离液体，

1619
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,570
good hemostasis\Ninside the wounds.

1620
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,570
伤口内止血良好。

1621
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,950
Nothing arterial.

1622
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,950
没有动脉出血。

1623
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,700
At first, he had\Na hemoglobin of 8.2.

1624
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,700
起初，他的血红蛋白为 8.2。

1625
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,210
We'll follow that closely.

1626
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,210
我们会密切监测。

1627
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,040
With no active bleeding,\NI wouldn't transfuse just yet.

1628
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,040
没有活动性出血，我现在还不会输血。

1629
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,130
Dr. Langdon agrees with you.

1630
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,130
兰登医生同意你的看法。

1631
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,300
Let's get him to CT.

1632
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,300
让我们把他送去做 CT 扫描。

1633
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,720
Jason Stills, 62,\Nwas gathering the makings

1634
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,720
62 岁的杰森·斯蒂尔斯正在准备沙拉的材料时，开始感到头晕和恶心。

1635
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,470
of a salad when he started\Nfeeling dizzy and nauseated.

1636
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,470
呕吐了一次。

1637
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,680
Vomited once.

1638
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,680
斯蒂尔斯先生，你感觉怎么样？

1639
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,930
How are you feeling,\NMr. Stills?

1640
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,930
How are you feeling, Mr. Stills?

1641
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,600
Like I'm gonna die.

1642
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,600
我快要死了。

1643
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,640
Well, you came to the right\Nplace to prevent that.

1644
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,640
好吧，你来对地方了，我们可以防止这种情况发生。

1645
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Do you mind\Nif I touch your abdomen?

1646
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
你介意我摸一下你的腹部吗？

1647
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,900
- Yeah, sure.\N- Okay.

1648
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,900
- 好的，可以。- 好的。

1649
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,230
- Does this hurt at all?\N- No.

1650
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,230
- 这样疼吗？- 不疼。

1651
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,480
He's tachycardic at 124\Nwith a temp of 102.4.

1652
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,480
他心动过速，心率 124 次/分，体温 102.4°F。

1653
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,490
Hey, Joy,\Nwhat's your suggestion?

1654
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,490
嘿，Joy，你有什么建议？

1655
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,160
Keep hydrating,\Ncheck electrolytes,

1656
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,160
继续补液，检查电解质，

1657
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,370
and move him\Nto the cooling room.

1658
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,370
把他转移到降温室。

1659
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,580
Precisely.

1660
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,580
完全同意。

1661
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,790
Good luck finding\Na parking spot.

1662
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,790
祝你找到停车位。

1663
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,830
- North 5.\N- What? No valet?

1664
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,830
- 北边 5 号。- 什么？没有代客泊车？

1665
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,630
Jada. Hey.

1666
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,630
杰达。嘿。

1667
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,840
I--I've been looking\Nall over for you.

1668
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,840
我——我一直在到处找你。

1669
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,340
I just went for a walk.

1670
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,340
我只是去散了个步。

1671
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,510
I wanted to talk to you,\Nif that's okay.

1672
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,510
我想和你谈谈，如果可以的话。

1673
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,090
So does Dr. Jefferson.

1674
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,090
杰斐逊医生也是这样想的。

1675
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,520
It's important that you get\Nto hear what he has to say.

1676
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,520
重要的是你要听听他要说的话。

1677
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,810
Why?

1678
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,810
为什么？

1679
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,890
He doesn't want me to go crazy\Nlike my brother?

1680
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,890
他不想让我像我哥哥一样疯掉？

1681
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,770
Or kill myself like my uncle?

1682
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,770
或者像我叔叔一样自杀？

1683
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,810
Of course not.

1684
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,810
当然不是。

1685
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,740
We--we still have no idea\Nwhat caused Jackson's episode.

1686
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,740
我们——我们仍然不知道是什么导致了杰克逊的发作。

1687
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,450
Episode.

1688
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,450
发作。

1689
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,570
Right.

1690
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,570
对。

1691
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,820
Look, I--I know this\Nmust be so scary for you.

1692
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,820
听着，我——我知道这对你来说一定很可怕。

1693
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,370
And you probably feel\Nbetrayed by your parents.

1694
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,370
你可能感到被父母背叛了。

1695
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,250
But they had no way\Nof knowing about Jackson.

1696
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,250
但他们不可能知道杰克逊的事。

1697
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,620
You know, and some families\Njust have a difficult time

1698
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,620
你知道，有些家庭就是很难

1699
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:54,050
talking about mental health.

1700
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:54,050
谈论心理健康问题。

1701
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,090
Now you can help us\Ntake the first steps

1702
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,090
现在你可以帮助我们迈出第一步

1703
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,550
to finding out what we can\Ndo to help your brother.

1704
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,550
找出我们能做什么来帮助你的哥哥。

1705
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,980
Mr. Diaz,\NI have a surprise for you.

1706
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,980
迪亚兹先生，我有个惊喜要告诉你。

1707
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,810
Oh.

1708
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,810
哦。

1709
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,070
Sorry.

1710
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,070
抱歉。

1711
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,480
It's okay.

1712
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,480
没关系。

1713
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,320
Have you--have you\Nseen my patient?

1714
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,320
你有没有——你有没有见过我的病人？

1715
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,070
Orlando? Mr. Diaz?

1716
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,070
奥兰多？迪亚兹先生？

1717
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,400
Room was empty.

1718
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,400
房间是空的。

1719
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,410
- Seriously?\N- Yeah.

1720
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,410
- 认真的吗？- 是的。

1721
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,590
What happened to you?

1722
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,590
你怎么了？

1723
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,460
Oh.

1724
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,460
哦。

1725
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,880
Bullet grazed my vest.

1726
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,880
子弹擦过了我的背心。

1727
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,090
You were shot?

1728
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,090
你被枪击了？

1729
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,760
Shot at.

1730
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,760
被射击了。

1731
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,970
Geniuses thought today was the\Nday to rob a goods warehouse.

1732
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,970
天才们认为今天是抢劫货物仓库的日子。

1733
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,260
Didn't think about\Nhow long it would take

1734
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,260
没有想到装载电器需要多长时间

1735
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,630
to load the appliances.

1736
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,630
来装载电器。

1737
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,930
They panicked.

1738
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,930
他们惊慌失措。

1739
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,220
All hell broke loose.

1740
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,220
一切都乱套了。

1741
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,020
Jesus.

1742
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,020
天哪。

1743
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,230
Why do you do this?

1744
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,230
你为什么要这样做？

1745
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,400
My therapist said\NI needed a hobby.

1746
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,400
我的治疗师说我需要一个爱好。

1747
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,980
Funny.

1748
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,980
真有趣。

1749
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,060
Shit.

1750
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,060
该死。

1751
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,240
This--this sucks.

1752
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,240
这——这太糟糕了。

1753
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,910
- Oh, it's nothing.\N- No.

1754
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,910
- 哦，没什么。- 不。

1755
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,330
No, don't worry about me.\NI'm fine. Seriously.

1756
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,330
不，别担心我。我很好。真的。

1757
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,580
No, my patient.

1758
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,580
不，我的病人。

1759
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,250
He didn't have any insurance,

1760
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,250
他没有任何保险，

1761
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,580
and he was already\Nin a mountain of medical debt.

1762
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,580
而且他已经背负了一大笔医疗债务。

1763
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,540
He couldn't afford\Nany of his meds.

1764
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,540
他买不起任何药物。

1765
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,870
Hmm.

1766
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,870
嗯。

1767
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,300
What's in the bag?

1768
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,300
包里装的是什么？

1769
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,260
Insulin, test strips,\Nelectrolyte powder.

1770
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,260
胰岛素、测试纸、电解质粉。

1771
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,050
I--I got him everything\Nhe needed for home care.

1772
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,050
我——我给他准备了居家护理所需的一切。

1773
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,270
So Uber it to his house.

1774
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,270
那就用优步送到他家。

1775
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,690
Is the hospital\Ngonna pay for that?

1776
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,690
医院会为此买单吗？

1777
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,900
I'll pay for it.

1778
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,900
我来付钱。

1779
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,950
What are you doing?

1780
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,950
你在做什么？

1781
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,570
What you clearly can't.

1782
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,570
你明显做不了的事。

1783
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,370
Did you make a chart?

1784
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,370
你制作图表了吗？

1785
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,660
No.

1786
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,660
不行。

1787
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,240
This can stay off the books.

1788
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,240
这可以不记录在案。

1789
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,250
Don't need the paperwork\Nfrom the hospital

1790
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,250
不需要医院的文件。

1791
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,080
or the police department.

1792
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,080
或警察局。

1793
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,170
Okay.

1794
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,170
好的。

1795
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,880
Our little secret.

1796
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,880
我们的小秘密。

1797
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,720
How's he doing?\NAny more seizures?

1798
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,720
他怎么样？还有发作吗？

1799
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,840
Nope.

1800
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,840
没有。

1801
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,140
Temp 102.9.

1802
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,140
体温 102.9°F。

1803
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,430
Labs back?

1804
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,430
化验结果出来了吗？

1805
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,050
Mostly signs of dehydration.

1806
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,050
主要是脱水的体征。

1807
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,770
A tad hypernatremic,\Nmild BUN and creatinine bump.

1808
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,770
钠离子稍高，BUN 和肌酐轻度升高。

1809
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,350
CK 400 something--\Nnothing worrisome yet.

1810
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,350
肌酸激酶 400 多——目前还没什么值得担心的。

1811
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,900
Okay, good. Keep cooling.

1812
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,900
好的，继续冷却。

1813
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,900
- I'll monitor him.\N- Great.

1814
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,900
- 我会监测他的情况。- 很好。

1815
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,070
That'll give Dr. Santos\Na chance to get caught up.

1816
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,070
这样可以给桑托斯医生追上进度的机会。

1817
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,040
Your R2 year\Ncan be challenging.

1818
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,040
你的 R2 年可能会很有挑战性。

1819
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,870
You just have to keep grinding.

1820
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,870
你只需要坚持不懈地努力。

1821
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,040
What's your dispo plan\Nfor Mr. Scott?

1822
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,040
你对斯科特先生的处置计划是什么？

1823
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,870
Uh, ICU admission.

1824
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,870
呃，入住 ICU。

1825
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,050
You should call Neurology\Nto consult.

1826
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,050
你应该打电话给神经科进行会诊。

1827
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,590
Yeah, done.

1828
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,590
是的，已经做了。

1829
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,050
Since it was exertional heat\Nillness in a young person,

1830
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,050
由于这是一个年轻人的劳累性热病，

1831
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,760
the mortality is low.

1832
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,760
死亡率很低。

1833
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,720
But non-exertional heatstroke\Nin an elderly person,

1834
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,720
但是老年人的非劳力性中暑，

1835
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,760
- you need to worry.\N- Okay.

1836
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,760
- 你需要担心。- 好的。

1837
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,840
I'll put in orders\Nfor repeat labs.

1838
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,840
我会下单进行重复检查。

1839
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,890
Good work in there.

1840
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,890
你在那里做得很好。

1841
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,780
This 49-year-old woman presents\Nto the emergency department--

1842
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,780
这位 49 岁的女性来到急诊科——

1843
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:17,620
Uh, with the chief complaint\Nof right ear pain.

1844
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:17,620
呃，主诉是右耳疼痛。

1845
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,420
Hey, Donnie, can you do\Nsomething about that?

1846
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,420
嘿，唐尼，你能处理一下吗？

1847
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,840
What?

1848
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,840
什么？

1849
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,340
Seriously?

1850
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,340
真的吗？

1851
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,170
That--that's not\Ndriving you nuts?

1852
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,170
那——那不会让你抓狂吗？

1853
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,220
The baby, it won't stop crying.

1854
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,220
婴儿一直在哭。

1855
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
Oh, that?\NIt's music to my ears now.

1856
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
哦，那个？现在对我来说就像天籁之音。

1857
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,680
I think Jesse's the nurse.

1858
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,680
我觉得杰西是护士。

1859
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,390
Well, can't you--ugh.

1860
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,390
好吧，你不能——呃。

1861
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,770
Fuck.

1862
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,770
该死。

1863
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,200
What the hell is going on?

1864
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,200
到底发生了什么？

1865
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,410
With what?

1866
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,410
什么事？

1867
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,410
With her.\NCan't you make her stop crying?

1868
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,410
关于她。你不能让她停止哭闹吗？

1869
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,580
She's been fed and changed.\NShe's cranky from rhinovirus.

1870
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,580
她已经吃过奶了，尿布也换过了。她是因为鼻病毒而烦躁。

1871
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,500
Isn't there something\Nthat you can do?

1872
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,500
你不能做点什么吗？

1873
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,120
She's due\Nfor her next Tylenol.

1874
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,120
她该吃下一剂泰诺林了。

1875
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,500
Give me a minute.\NI'll be right back.

1876
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,500
给我一分钟。我马上回来。

1877
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,760
Wait, no, no, no,\NI'm not gonna stay here.

1878
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,760
等等，不，不，不，我不会留在这里。

1879
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,550
What is your problem?

1880
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,550
你有什么问题？

1881
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,600
This is precisely why\NI didn't go into Pedes.

1882
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,600
这正是我没有进入儿科的原因。

1883
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,820
Okay.

1884
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,820
好的。

1885
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,640
Hey, hey.

1886
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,640
嘿，嘿。

1887
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,780
Hey, little Miss Sunshine.

1888
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,780
嘿，小阳光小姐。

1889
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,620
Is it time for you\Nto take a little nap?

1890
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,620
该是你小睡一会儿的时候了吗？

1891
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,790
That would be so fucking nice.

1892
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,790
那真他妈的太好了。

1893
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,110
Yes, it would.

1894
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,110
是的，会的。

1895
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:38,500
I'm starting to understand\Nwhy you got left here.

1896
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:38,500
我开始理解你为什么被留在这里了。

1897
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,750
Hey, shh.

1898
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,750
嘿，别说话。

1899
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,540
What's the word from CT?

1900
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,540
来自 CT 的结果怎么样？

1901
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,550
Nothing intrathoracic,\Nnothing intra-abdominal.

1902
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,550
胸腔内没有异常，腹腔内也没有异常。

1903
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,010
Propeller just\Nmissed gutting him.

1904
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,010
螺旋桨差点把他的肠子割出来。

1905
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,430
- Very fortunate.\N- Okay.

1906
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,430
- 非常幸运。- 好的。

1907
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,350
Repeat hemoglobin is 8.

1908
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,350
血红蛋白复查是 8。

1909
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,060
We're holding off\Non transfusing.

1910
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,060
我们暂时不输血。

1911
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,640
Plan?

1912
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,640
计划是什么？

1913
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,820
I'll have Mel and Langdon\Nsuture up the lacerations.

1914
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,820
我让梅尔和兰登缝合伤口。

1915
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,060
Wait, what?\NThat could take days.

1916
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,060
等等，什么？那要花好几天。

1917
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,360
I--I can't--

1918
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,360
我——我不能——

1919
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,320
Calm down, Sadness.\NI'm kidding.

1920
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,320
冷静，悲伤。我在开玩笑。

1921
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,900
This is one for my skilled\Nsurgical residents upstairs,

1922
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,900
这个要交给楼上我的高级住院医生。

1923
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,410
not you Boy Scout butchers.

1924
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,410
不是你们这些童子军屠夫。

1925
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,780
Boy, I missed you, Yoyo.

1926
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,780
天哪，我想你了，悠悠。

1927
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,030
Mm. Can't say the same.

1928
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,030
嗯。我可不能这么说。

1929
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,580
Okay, let's take up\Nthis art project.

1930
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,580
好吧，让我们开始这个艺术项目。

1931
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,910
So about before--

1932
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,910
那么关于之前的事——

1933
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,960
Back to it.

1934
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,960
回到正题。

1935
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,370
Good talk.

1936
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,370
很好的谈话。

1937
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,880
How we doing, Princess?

1938
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,880
怎么样，公主？

1939
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,460
All right.\NA little bloated.

1940
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,460
还好。有点胀。

1941
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,920
I had one too many hot dogs\Nfrom the truck.

1942
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,920
我从卡车上吃了太多热狗。

1943
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,970
You meant the board, huh?

1944
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,970
你是说董事会啊？

1945
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,100
Gus, our incarcerated patient,\Ngot a spot upstairs.

1946
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,100
我们的被监禁患者古斯在楼上有了一个床位。

1947
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,730
Looking for our unhoused\Npatient, Digby, and, of course,

1948
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,730
在寻找我们的无家可归患者迪格比，当然，

1949
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,600
we have Whitaker, Donahue,\Nand the med students

1950
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,600
我们还有惠特克、多纳休和医学生

1951
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,270
on these diversion intakes,\Nbut they just keep coming.

1952
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,270
在处理这些转诊入院，但他们源源不断地来。

1953
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,230
Yeah, we may need to start\Njust sending people up

1954
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,230
是的，我们可能需要开始直接派人上去

1955
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,560
and ask for forgiveness\Ninstead of permission.

1956
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,560
然后请求原谅而不是事先征求许可。

1957
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,070
Hello?

1958
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,070
喂？

1959
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,360
Oh, okay.

1960
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,360
好的。

1961
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,620
Yes, I will be right there.

1962
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,620
好的，我马上就到。

1963
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,200
C-suite wants\Nto see me upstairs.

1964
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,200
高管层想在楼上见我。

1965
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,570
Ooh, called\Nto the principal's office

1966
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,570
哎呀，第一天就被叫到校长办公室

1967
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,830
on your first day--\Nnot a good sign.

1968
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,830
——不是个好兆头。

1969
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,410
- I think I'm a baby whisperer.\N- Hey, great.

1970
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,410
- 我觉得我是个哄小孩的高手。- 嘿，太好了。

1971
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,630
We'll add Baby Jane Doe\Nto your patient load.

1972
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,630
我们会把"婴儿简·多伊"加到你的患者名单里。

1973
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,090
Forget I said anything.

1974
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,090
当我没说过。

1975
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,960
Where are we with\Nyour deaf patient, Harlow?

1976
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,960
你那位聋人患者现在怎么样了，哈洛？

1977
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,600
Uh, the VRI was a bust, but\Nthe interpreter's on the way.

1978
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,600
呃，远程视频翻译没用，但翻译员正在赶来。

1979
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,550
Figured I'd just give her\Na head and belly scan

1980
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,550
我想我就先给她做头部和腹部扫描

1981
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,760
- and go from there.\N- No, wait for the interpreter.

1982
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,760
- 然后再看情况。- 不，等翻译员来。

1983
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:01,270
No need to give the patient\Nunnecessary radiation.

1984
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:01,270
没必要让患者接受不必要的辐射。

1985
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,640
And your charting?

1986
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,640
你的图表怎么样？

1987
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,100
Catching up\Nand checking it twice.

1988
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,100
正在赶进度，检查两遍。

1989
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,560
Good.

1990
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,560
很好。

1991
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,980
Hey, have you had a chance\Nto speak to Langdon today?

1992
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,980
嘿，你今天有机会和兰登谈过话吗？

1993
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,770
Uh, no.

1994
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,770
呃，没有。

1995
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,070
Why? Did he say something?

1996
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,070
为什么？他说了什么吗？

1997
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,690
No, just curious.

1998
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,690
没有，只是好奇。

1999
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,080
How is everything at home\Nwith you and Whitaker?

2000
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,080
你和惠特克在家里一切都好吗？

2001
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,450
He's weirder\Nthan you'd expect.

2002
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,450
他比你想象的要奇怪得多。

2003
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,240
- Hmm.\N- Yeah.

2004
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,240
- 嗯。- 是的。

2005
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:23,330
But I don't see him\Nall that much.

2006
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:23,330
但我不经常见到他。

2007
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,950
He spends a lot of time\Nat Amy's.

2008
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,950
他花很多时间在艾米那里。

2009
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,330
He has a girlfriend?

2010
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,330
他有女朋友？

2011
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,130
I don't know what to call it.

2012
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,130
我不知道该怎么称呼它。

2013
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,670
The--the farmer\Nwho got burned last year

2014
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,670
那个——去年被烧伤的农民

2015
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,250
the day of the mass cas,\Nhis widow, Amy.

2016
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,250
大规模伤亡事件那天，他的遗孀，艾米。

2017
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,550
Oh, he died?

2018
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,550
哦，他死了？

2019
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,590
Yeah, he had burns\Non 90% of his body.

2020
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,590
是的，他身体 90%的部位都被烧伤了。

2021
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,470
His chance of survival\Nwas very slim.

2022
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,470
他的生存机会非常渺茫。

2023
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,050
Okay, so I'm an optimist.

2024
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,050
好吧，我是个乐观主义者。

2025
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,640
The sun doesn't always\Ncome out tomorrow, Annie.

2026
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,640
太阳不会总是在明天出现，安妮。

2027
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,520
Wait, wasn't she pregnant?

2028
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,520
等等，她不是怀孕了吗？

2029
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,190
No, she was a young orphan.

2030
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,190
不，她是个年轻的孤儿。

2031
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,520
No, not Annie. Amy.

2032
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,520
不，不是安妮。是艾米。

2033
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:56,240
Yes.\NYes, very pregnant and young.

2034
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:56,240
是的。是的，非常年轻，而且怀孕了。

2035
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,200
Whitaker is now\Nseeing this Amy?

2036
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,200
惠特克现在在和这个艾米交往？

2037
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,240
And her baby.

2038
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,240
还有她的孩子。

2039
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,070
He got really close\Nto the family

2040
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,070
他和这个家庭变得非常亲近。

2041
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,910
when the husband was dying.

2042
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,910
当丈夫快要去世的时候。

2043
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,080
He really believed that\Nthe guy would pull through.

2044
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,080
他真的相信那家伙会度过难关。

2045
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,580
He helped her through\Nthe loss of her husband,

2046
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,580
他帮助她度过了失去丈夫的难关，

2047
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,200
and then again\Nwhen she had the kid,

2048
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,200
后来当她生孩子时又帮了一次，

2049
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,540
and now he spends almost\Nevery weekend at the farm.

2050
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,540
现在他几乎每个周末都在农场里度过。

2051
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,800
Huh.

2052
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,800
嗯。

2053
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,260
Plus,\Nhe's on the street team,

2054
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,260
而且，他在街头小队，

2055
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,050
and he just wants\Nto help everybody.

2056
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,050
他只是想帮助每个人。

2057
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:21,180
And I just don't wanna see him\Ntaken advantage of, you know?

2058
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:21,180
我只是不想看到他被利用，你懂吗？

2059
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,350
He's just\Na fucking Huckleberry.

2060
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,350
他就是个该死的傻瓜。

2061
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,100
Yeah, but he's our\Nfucking Huckleberry.

2062
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,100
是啊，但他是我们他妈的人。

2063
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,600
I'll talk to him.

2064
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,600
我会和他谈谈。

2065
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,810
Hey, your call.

2066
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,810
嘿，你说了算。

2067
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,730
Strong deflection.\NWell played.

2068
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,730
很好的转移话题。玩得不错。

2069
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,060
You're the boss.

2070
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,060
你是老板。

2071
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:33,780
Or you are until\Nend of shift today.

2072
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:33,780
或者直到今天班次结束。

2073
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,990
Still the boss.

2074
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,990
仍然是首领。

2075
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,320
When you see me in here,\Nstill the boss.

2076
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,320
当你在这里看到我时，仍然是首领。

2077
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,740
Copy that, Boss.

2078
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,740
明白了，首领。

2079
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,200
Dr. Robby, can--\Ncan I grab you for a second?

2080
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,200
罗比医生，能——能耽误你一秒钟吗？

2081
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,080
Yeah. Sure. What's up?

2082
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,080
是的。当然。怎么了？

2083
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,120
Um, can't you order\Nmy wife to go home?

2084
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,120
嗯，你不能命令我妻子回家吗？

2085
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,880
I'm sorry.

2086
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,880
我很抱歉。

2087
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,760
My wife's dying,

2088
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,760
我妻子快要死了，

2089
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,640
and you're telling me\Nthere's nothing I can do?

2090
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,640
你却告诉我我无能为力？

2091
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,220
Mr. Hamler, that's not--

2092
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,220
哈姆勒先生，那不是——

2093
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,720
No, no.

2094
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,720
不，不。

2095
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,510
There's gotta be something.

2096
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,510
一定有什么办法。

2097
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,310
Please.

2098
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,310
拜托。

2099
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,430
It may not seem like much,\Nbut right now,

2100
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,430
这看起来可能不算什么，但现在，

2101
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,980
you being here for her\Nand respecting her wishes

2102
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,980
你在她身边陪伴她，尊重她的意愿

2103
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,810
is the best thing that\Nyou can do for her.

2104
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,810
对她来说是你能做的最好的事情。

2105
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,780
Supporting her and her choices\Nis the most remarkable gift

2106
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,780
支持她和她的选择是你在这个时刻能给她的最非凡的礼物

2107
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,070
that you can give her\Nat this time.

2108
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,070
你能给她的。

2109
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,860
And the meds we have her on\Nwill help her pain.

2110
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,860
我们给她用的药物会帮助缓解她的疼痛。

2111
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,830
And she may get\Nto a point where

2112
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,830
她可能会到达一个阶段

2113
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,620
she feels well enough\Nto go home.

2114
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,620
她感觉好得足以回家了。

2115
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,970
Give me one second.

2116
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,970
给我一秒钟。

2117
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,030
Okay, I'm gonna\Nlet you guys get acquainted.

2118
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,030
好的，我让你们彼此认识一下。

2119
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,390
I will be right back.

2120
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,390
我马上回来。

2121
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,820
Oh, oh, oh, excuse me!

2122
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,820
哦，哦，哦，对不起！

2123
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,740
I--I'm waiting for Dr. Mohan.\NIs she available?

2124
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,740
我——我在等莫汉医生。她有空吗？

2125
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,450
I will try\Nand find her for you, sir.

2126
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,450
我会尽力为你找到她，先生。

2127
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:10,370
Whether you choose to report\Nor not, we're here for you.

2128
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:10,370
无论你是否选择报告，我们都在这里支持你。

2129
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,740
Call me any time.

2130
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,740
随时给我打电话。

2131
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,290
It could be a month\Nor a year from now.

2132
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,290
可能是一个月后，也可能是一年后。

2133
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,620
I'll follow up with you too.

2134
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,620
我也会跟进你的情况。

2135
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,420
Thank you.

2136
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,420
谢谢你。

2137
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,250
Thanks.

2138
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,250
谢谢。

2139
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,170
You've had a pap smear before?

2140
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,170
你之前做过宫颈涂片检查吗？

2141
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,350
Yeah, every few years.

2142
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,350
有的，每隔几年做一次。

2143
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:28,720
Good.

2144
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:28,720
很好。

2145
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,220
Same position,\Nbut I'll start with swabs

2146
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,220
姿势相同，但我先从外部取样

2147
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,100
on the outside,\Nexternal genitalia.

2148
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,100
外阴部位。

2149
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,570
Then I'll use a speculum\Nto get internal swabs.

2150
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,570
然后我会用窥器进行内部取样。

2151
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,490
You ready? Okay.

2152
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,490
你准备好了吗？好的。

2153
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,020
I'll help you get your feet\Nin the stirrups.

2154
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,020
我来帮你把脚放进马镫。

2155
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,070
Good.

2156
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,070
很好。

2157
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,440
Okay. All right.

2158
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,440
好的。没问题。

2159
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,410
Now, slide your bottom down.

2160
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,410
现在，把你的臀部往下滑。

2161
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,080
Oh. Yeah, a little bit more.

2162
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,080
哦。是的，再往下一点。

2163
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,700
A little more.

2164
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,700
再多一点。

2165
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,380
- Sorry. I--I can't.\N- Okay. It's okay.

2166
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,380
- 对不起。我--我不能。- 好的。没关系。

2167
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,960
We can take a break.\NNo problem.

2168
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,960
我们可以休息一下。没问题。

2169
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,500
I don't want a break.\NI wanna stop.

2170
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,500
我不想休息。我想停止。

2171
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:03,340
Okay.\NIs this about reporting?

2172
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:03,340
好的。这是关于报告的吗？

2173
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,960
Because you can do\Nthis collection

2174
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,960
因为你现在可以进行这项检查

2175
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,590
without a police report\Nfor now.

2176
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,590
而不需要警方报告。

2177
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,230
And none of it goes in your\Npermanent medical record.

2178
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,230
而且这些都不会进入你的永久病历。

2179
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,140
I don't wanna do this\Nanymore.

2180
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,140
我不想再这样做了。

2181
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,390
Tell me why you wanna stop.

2182
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,390
告诉我你为什么想停止。

2183
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,770
He's my friend.

2184
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,770
他是我的朋友。

2185
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:22,770
He knows all my friends.

2186
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:22,770
他认识我所有的朋友。

2187
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,200
It was just a dumb--

2188
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,200
这只是一个愚蠢的——

2189
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,530
he was drunk,\Nhe didn't mean it.

2190
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,530
他喝醉了，他不是故意的。

2191
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:31,200
- It didn't mean anything.\N- Okay.

2192
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:31,200
- 这没有什么意义。- 好的。

2193
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,450
Okay.

2194
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,450
好的。

2195
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,540
It's okay. I understand.

2196
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,540
没关系。我理解。

2197
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,040
I do.

2198
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,040
我确实理解。

2199
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:43,840
Ilana, this is a difficult\Nprocess, to say the least.

2200
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:43,840
伊拉娜，说句老实话，这是一个很困难的过程。

2201
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,880
Why don't you take a breather\Nand come back?

2202
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,880
你为什么不休息一下，然后回来？

2203
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,720
And whatever you wanna do,\Nwe'll do.

2204
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,720
你想做什么，我们就做什么。

2205
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,480
Let's go find\Nthe good snacks.

2206
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,480
我们去找点好吃的。

2207
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,720
Jesus Christ.

2208
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,720
天哪。

2209
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:25,250
Sorry.

2210
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:25,250
抱歉。

2211
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,800
Giving new meaning\Nto the nickname Crash, huh?

2212
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,800
给绰号"撞车"赋予了新的含义，是吧？

2213
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,340
I've been trying to get\Nto the bathroom

2214
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,340
我一直在试图进浴室

2215
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,890
for over an hour now.

2216
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,890
已经超过一个小时了。

2217
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,810
Yeah, you and me both,\Nsister.

2218
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,810
是啊，我也是，姐妹。

2219
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,490
Uh-oh, this can't be good.

2220
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,490
哎呀，这不是好兆头。

2221
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,820
Who's this?

2222
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,820
这是谁？

2223
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,110
That is hospital CEO\NTrent Norris.

2224
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,110
那是医院首席执行官特伦特·诺里斯。

2225
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,620
He's the big boss.

2226
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,620
他是大老板。

2227
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,040
Hmm. Nice outfit.

2228
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,040
嗯。不错的装扮。

2229
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,960
Hey, Rockstar.\NGather your staff, please.

2230
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,960
嘿，摇滚明星。请集合你的员工。

2231
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,240
Sure, anything you\Nwanna tell me first?

2232
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,240
当然，你想先告诉我什么吗？

2233
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,290
- No.\N- Okay.

2234
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,290
- 不。- 好的。

2235
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,620
Hey, everybody, can you,\Nuh, gather 'round

2236
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,620
嘿，各位，你们能不能聚过来

2237
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,130
and listen up\Nfor a moment, please?

2238
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,130
听我说一会儿，拜托了？

2239
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,670
Can I have your attention,\Neveryone?

2240
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,670
各位，能请你们注意一下吗？

2241
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,300
Internal disaster at Westbridge

2242
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,300
韦斯特布里奇内部灾难

2243
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,510
has been identified\Nas a cyberattack.

2244
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,510
已被确认为网络攻击。

2245
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,230
And now Good Dominion Hospital\Nhas been hit as well.

2246
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,230
现在好撒玛利亚医院也遭到了攻击。

2247
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,650
Their ambulances are being\Ndiverted over to St. Mary's,

2248
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,650
他们的救护车正被转向圣玛丽医院，

2249
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,150
but we can expect more walk-ins\Nand Westbridge diversions.

2250
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,150
但我们可以预期会有更多自行前往的患者和韦斯特布里奇的转院。

2251
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,940
Uh, for how long?

2252
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,940
呃，要多久？

2253
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,270
We don't know how long.\NIf the ransom is paid--

2254
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,270
我们不知道要多久。如果支付赎金的话——

2255
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,950
Ransom?

2256
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,950
赎金？

2257
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,620
Are we next?

2258
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,620
我们接下来会不会也遭殃？

2259
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,330
Our IT protection system\Nhas blocked thousands

2260
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,330
我们的 IT 保护系统在这几个小时内已经阻止了数千次

2261
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,910
of intrusion attempts\Nin the hours

2262
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,910
入侵尝试

2263
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,080
since Westbridge was hit\Nthis morning.

2264
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,080
自从今早韦斯特布里奇遭到袭击以来。

2265
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,120
But IT believes\Nwe're still vulnerable.

2266
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,120
但信息技术部门认为我们仍然很脆弱。

2267
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,840
So we're gonna\Npreemptively shut down

2268
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,840
所以我们要主动关闭

2269
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,420
all the computer systems.

2270
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,420
所有的计算机系统。

2271
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,090
- Oh, my God.\N- Jesus.

2272
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,090
- 天哪。- 天哪。

2273
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,840

2274
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,840
患者登记、电子健康记录、

2275
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:56,020
lab and radiology interfaces,\Nemail, internet.

2276
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:56,020
实验室和放射学接口、电子邮件、互联网。

2277
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,270
You didn't wanna\Ntalk to me first?

2278
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,270
你不想先和我谈话吗？

2279
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:58,640
You didn't wanna\Nconsult my department?

2280
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:58,640
你不想咨询我的科室吗？

2281
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,470
I consulted\Nyour fellow attending.

2282
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,470
我咨询了你的同事主治医生。

2283
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:06,020
When are we going down?

2284
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:06,020
我们什么时候下去？

2285
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:08,820
Soon. Very soon.

2286
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:08,820
很快。非常快。

2287

Okay, hey, somebody get\Na picture of the board.

好的，嘿，谁来拍一下这块板子。

2289
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,490
Quickly, quickly!\NWe're about to go analog.

2290
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,490
快点，快点！我们就要转向模拟了。

2291
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,250
- No!\N- Oh, my gosh.

2292
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,250
- 不！- 哦，天哪。

2293
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,540
- Phones work?\N- They don't work.

2294
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,540
- 手机能用吗？- 不能用。

2295
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,330
- Oh, my gosh.\N- Did you get the photo?

2296
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,330
